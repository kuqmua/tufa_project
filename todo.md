    Ok(x * 2)
}
            
* optimize for loop for std::env::var to std::env::vars
but will it be safe?

* env vars names - make it private

* seaORM instead of diesel?
https://www.sea-ql.org/SeaORM/
Diesel	SeaORM
Sync	Async
Static	Dynamic
Native Driver	Pure Rust
Relational
Schema first
MySQL / Postgres / SQLite
NOPE, NOT STABLE YET
check it in the middle of 2022

* restructure config with prints Structure fields (together some inner structs)
            
* remove unwrap() into expect() to give more meaning
except maybe loops or early return cases 

* warning: variant is never constructed: `PostgreSql`
  --> src/providers_info/get_project_information/get_providers_link_parts.rs:62:5
   |
62 |     PostgreSql,
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^
   |
   = note: `#[warn(dead_code)]` on by default

* Result instead of option in all code possible coz return Option loosing information about error 

* big enum of enums(recursive) of all errors in project

* move providers link parts (specific urls) to project constants

* if error size > then ok return type then allocate error on heap, otherwise actual return type would be more then needed
maybe write some tests or linter or lib or rustanalyzer flag to check it

* Rename all functions return type to mean something.
type = ....

* wrap blocking diesel function into spawn blocking under tokio runtime
(rustacean station - tokio ecosystem with alice ryhl) 24:30

* procedural macros for config fields like vec![]. with correct naming require
without typed enums
like 
Config {
  test_field: from_env!(test_field.to_upper_snake_case()) 
}

* reuse files with functions and constants using #[path=""] instead of module system
its maybe bad practice but must work

* try SNAFU as error handling crate 
https://crates.io/crates/snafu

* LINKS_LIMIT_PROVIDERS not working now. fix it

* parameter db initialization provider link parts source must be
different than PROVIDERS_LINK_PARTS_SOURCE 

* divide and move outside postgres and mongo methods from provider_kind_methods 

* rewrite prints like this
let person = get_person();
// ...
println!("Hello, {person}!"); // captures the local `person`
  
* fs::remove_dir_all(&path)?; //todo: its blocking, rewrite to async
  
* inside get_all_local_providers_data
get_enabled_providers_vec should be get_enabled_initialiation_providers_vec. add additional vars into env file

* docker build image inside ci pipeline

* use Rc instead of Arc in cases with one thread.
Between threads still must use Arc

* can implement this
impl User<u32> {

}
meaning implementation only for u32 type
  
* use checked_sub() and checked_add() methods

* in cases across await points use tokio::sync::Mutex instead of std Mutex
use this lint 
https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#await_holding_lock
  
* links limits and other getters functions like before on config new initialization (before proc macro)

* add connect_timeout to all mongo client_options usage
  
* add time to errors like this ./server/utils/dependencies.ts:524:17  15:30:40 25.01.22 
(partially done)

* add params dependency function to config after new to check. like if is_mongo_initialization_enabled is true but is_dbs_initialization_enabled is false so is_mongo_initialization_enabled is also false
  
* https://blog.turbo.fish/proc-macro-error-handling/

* actix-web html + session-based-authentication
https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/session-based-authentication-in-rust/
  
* there is a function to handle request error status inside reqwest crate
.error_for_status()

* add check on ports fields from env or config to be not equal 0-1000 range
  
* routes 
/api/html/info
/api/json/info
/api/protobuf/info

* cut enum extension into few different proc macroses
* write match should trace inside init or new function of error initialization
* env var json tracing on/off
* different formatting for env var json tracing on/off

//end server

//start server tests
* parsing providers posts tests

* server what running web tests every hour like http requests and get valid data or not
github parsing version to check different structs of posts as test in the loop

* Add tests for new libraries versions and what version i use. 
Like http request to crates.io or something similar

* write test what checks if something missing in .dockerignore and .gitignore - local or ci? 

* Write tests what checks all function to have #![deny(,   unwrap_used)]

* test to check what cargo run executes in the right folder

* test what check commit name for only eng symbols

* #[should_panic(expected = "99")]
write some tests with with macro

* Right test what parse repo code and check what each function returns some type or enum

* create big json file to test parsing speed as test

* test for all env var to working and usage

* is there some test implementation that checks all your rust project functions (with result return type) on difference between return type in case of ok and error? i mean for cases where size of ok must be >= size of error. if otherwise im going to use Box(Error) in case of error. i think it can be done with big proc macro that expand test.

* test or proc macro to name error function type like function but with CamelCase and ErrorStruct on the end

* check all files names to not contain ":" symbol. its needed to correct parsing line

* check all files name be equal to his inner struct/function

* try to use nexttest instead of cargo test
https://nexte.st/
https://github.com/nextest-rs/nextest
//end server tests

//start server thoughts
* add everywhere explicit types
Except maybe functional way 

* 
```
std::stringify
```

* 
```
std::str::SplitN
```

* 
```
split().map()
instead of find(<item></item>)
```

* error had .description method
maybe rewrite error messages?
But description is depreciated

* hashmaps into vecs

* &str instead of std::string::String everywhere if possible

* 'static remove if possible or maybe add if its better 

* ensure! macros

* RES.STATUS: 521 <unknown status code>

* operation timed out print time elapsed

* 
```
Rc<RefCell<Data>>
Rc::new(<RefCell::new(Data { value: 42}))
```

* find out why constants which used in tests looks like unused

* google some style guide variable naming for project(parsing espesially) and rename variables

* [dependencies] and [dev-dependencies] read about it

Number::One => ErrorNumber::One
Number::Two => ErrorNumber::One
Its not a  TYPE SAFE Graph, coz it's compiled successfully

* how to do error handling:
```
pub struct Error(Box<ErrorImpl>);

enum ErrorImpl {
     EverythingWentBad,
     Aaaaaaaaaaa,
}
```
if size_of::<ErrorImpl>() > size_of::<usize>() - its rare
and it is assumed that errors are rare 
and it is assumed that with such an error T inside Result<T, Error> 
if this return true
size_of::<ErrorImpl>() > size_of::<T>()... 
then do Box<>

example from serde_json
https://github.com/serde-rs/json/blob/3f459308f5055e9a4b1b611a77dad07132011e8d/src/error.rs#L16-L19

https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#large_enum_variant 
linter for it big error enums

* while using Result<SomeType, SomeError>
if size_of::<SomeError> > size_of::<Box<SomeError>> (i think its == usize (32 or 64))
then using Box version will be allocation on runtime.
so if errors will be inside loop or multiple parallel tasks
program can allocate on runtime...
the question IS: how many allocations program must do on runtime to slow down the program?
what the difference between 
*1 a little less stack size on runtime with possible allocations( with what % of execution time)
*2 a bigger stack size without possible allocations on runtime
so we need to implement 2 versions inside program
and switch between them watching error allocation statistics

...also write different error types for allocation trottling cases
and unefficiency stack-based version.
like 
big error version for lower allocation statistics
small error (yeah with less info about error) version for high allocation statistics
(in small version still allocate big error version from time to time - for more info)

check path exists in file system
    
* let a = async { 10 }.delay(Duration::from_secs(10));
let b = async { 11 };
try using race for different dbs or local files.
for example get provider link parts from mongo postgres local using race
assert_eq!(a.race(b).await, 11);

race - wait for first output, return early on error
join - wait for all ouputs, continue on error
try_join - wait for all outputs, return early on error
try race - wait for first output, continue on error

* Cargo now shows you warnings when a dependency will be rejected by a future version of Rust. After running cargo build or cargo check, you might see:
warning: the following packages contain code that will be rejected by a future version of Rust: old_dep v0.1.0
note: to see what the problems were, use the option `--future-incompat-report`, or run `cargo report future-incompatibilities --id 1`
You can run the cargo report command mentioned in the warning to see a full report of the code that will be rejected. This gives you time to upgrade your dependency before it breaks your build.
    
* On Linux, you can induce a system reboot by writing a b to /proc/sysrq-trigger (if you’re going to try this you probably want to use a VM):
echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger
We can sort of simulate an operating system level crash (or having the plug pulled on our server rack) by using this:
```
pub fn reboot_kernel() {
    File::create("/proc/sysrq-trigger")
        .unwrap()
        .write_all(b"b")
        .unwrap();
}
```

* Rust exposes this system call via the File::sync_all method. If we call sync_all, when it returns successfully, the operating system promises that the data has been written to disk and will exist on disk even in the event of a hard crash like a power failure or OS crash. As I’ve tried to emphasize repeatedly, this is an oversimplification, and many things can go wrong depending on your filesystem configuration, but for today, let’s keep things simple and assume syncing is a reliable process.

* Sometimes you need to write methods that accept a string slice (&str) and conditionally return either a modified version of it or the original one. For these cases, you might use Cow<str>, so that you only allocate new memory when necessary.
```
use std::borrow::Cow;
fn capitalize(name: &str) -> Cow<str> {
    match name.chars().nth(0) {
        Some(first_char) if first_char.is_uppercase() => {
            // No allocation is necessary, as the string
            // already starts with an uppercase char
            Cow::Borrowed(name)
        }
        Some(first_char) => {
            // An allocation is necessary, as the old string
            // does not start with an uppercase char
            let new_string: std::string::String = first_char.to_uppercase()
              .chain(name.chars().skip(1))
              .collect();
            Cow::Owned(new_string)
        },
        None => Cow::Borrowed(name),
    }
}
fn main() {
    println!("{}", capitalize("bob"));   // Allocation
    println!("{}", capitalize("John"));  // No allocation
}
```
If you’re using VSCode + Rust Analyzer, I highly suggest going into the settings > Rust Analyzer > Check On Save: Command and setting "clippy" as the new default instead of "check". Same UX, better warnings.
