<![CDATA[ Craving is a central construct in the study of motivation and human behavior and is also a clinical symptom of substance and non-substance-related addictive disorders. Thus, craving represents a target for transdiagnostic modeling. We applied connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) to functional connectivity data in a large (N=274) transdiagnostic sample of individuals with and without substance-use-related conditions, to predict self-reported craving. CPM is a machine-learning approach used to identify neural signatures in functional connectivity data related to a specific phenotype. Functional connectomes were derived from three guided imagery conditions of personalized appetitive, stress, and neutral-relaxing experiences. Craving was rated before and after each imagery condition. CPM successfully predicted craving, thereby identifying a transdiagnostic craving network comprised primarily of the posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, visual cortex, and primary sensory areas. Findings suggest that craving may be associated with difficulties directing attention away from internal self-related processing, represented in the default mode network. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the principal phyto-cannabinoids in the cannabis plant. The differential and possibly antagonistic effects of these compounds on specific brain and behavioral responses, and the mechanisms underlying their effects have generated extensive interest in pre-clinical and clinical neuroscience investigations. In this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled counterbalanced human laboratory experiment, we examined the effects of three different dose ratios of CBD: THC (1:1, 2:1 and 3:1) on neural noise, an electrophysiological biomarker of psychosis known to be sensitive to cannabinoids as well as subjective and psychotomimetic effects. Interestingly, the lowest CBD:THC ratio (1:1) resulted in maximal attenuation of both THC induced psychotomimetic effects (PANSS positive - ATS = 7.83, df = 1, pcorr = 0.015) and neural noise (ATS = 8.83, df = 1, pcorr = 0.009) with an inverse-linear dose response relationship. Further, in line with previous studies, addition of CBD did not reduce the subjective experience of THC induced "high" (p > 0.05 for all CBD doses). These novel results demonstrate that CBD attenuates THC induced subjective and objective effects relevant to psychosis- but in a dose/ratio dependent manner. Given the increasing global trend of cannabis liberalization and application for medical indications, these results assume considerable significance given the potential dose related interactions of these key phyto-cannabinoids. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundThe large increase in opioid use, subsequent addiction and related death has come to be known as a national epidemic in the United States, particularly affecting rural areas. The crisis has been met with an increase in attempts to address the large overdose rates. In many of these strategies, first responders such as police and emergency services personnel are placed on the front lines. The input and opinions of these individuals, and the communication with them from agency leadership during program implementation can dramatically affect the success of drug related policies. However, there is a paucity of research focused on the attitudes of primary responders, particularly in rural settings. This study conducts a geographically-focused investigation into the attitudes of rural EMS and law enforcement personnel in regards to opioid treatment in a location that was currently implementing a major substance use policy. MethodsQualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 members of law enforcement and 22 emergency medical providers within a single rural county in North Carolina. Interviews spanned three sections: demographics, barriers to opioid treatment and county-specific programs. ResultsThe largest barriers to care cited were lack of local treatment resources, the stigma against drug use and a perception that people who use opioids did not want to change. A multi-agency approach to the crisis was supported by EMS personnel and law enforcement. However, first responders awareness of an active multiagency county-wide initiative was very limited. This was very surprising, as first responders were expected to implement the program, and this phenomena resulted in very low program efficacy to that point. This result underscored the importance of communication between and within agencies, particularly in environments that are resource-constrained. ConclusionsThis study is unique in comparing attitudes of rural EMS and law enforcement regarding substance use treatment. This paper provides insight into the viewpoints of rural first responders, with clear implications for rural drug policy. This paper further underscores opportunities for maximizing effective opioid policy in rural settings, particularly emphasizing clear communication between agencies. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundConstruction artisans are those who perform skilled work relating to the erection or assembly of a large structure. These artisans are prone to tobacco use. This study aims to assess the prevalence and the associated risk factors of tobacco use amongst construction artisans in Ekiti State, Nigeria. Materials and MethodsThis cross-sectional study employed a multi-stage sampling technique to select participants (carpenters and bricklayers) artisans, journeymen, and their apprentices who were working in Ekiti State. Chi-square and logistic regression were used to test for association in bivariate and multivariate analyses respectively. ResultsThe prevalence of ever-smoke amongst respondents was 19.3%. Multivariate analysis showed that artisans who were within the age range 31-40 years were four times more likely to use tobacco (OR=3.410; CI=1.476-7.878). Similarly, being in school and divorced/separated were associated with tobacco use. ConclusionNoting the increased prevalence of tobacco use among construction artisans when compared to the general population, and few self-reported cases of addiction amongst users demands action from communities and government at all levels. ]]>

We also used genomic structural equation modeling to model a substance use common genetic factor and examined its genetic overlap with brain structure. After accounting for multiple testing, we identified eight significant negative genetic correlations, including between alcoholic drinks per week and average cortical thickness and intracranial volume with the age of smoking initiation; and five positive genetic correlations, including between insula surface area and lifetime cannabis use, and between the common factor with pericalcarine surface area.

<![CDATA[ sychostimulant and opioid reinstatement of drug seeking after extinction of drug self-administration and incubation of drug craving (time-dependent increase in drug seeking during abstinence). We also discuss ovarian hormones role in relapse and craving in humans and animal models and speculate on brain mechanisms underlying their role in cocaine craving and relapse in rodent models. Finally, we discuss imaging studies on brain responses to cocaine cues and stress in men and women. The results of the clinical studies reviewed do not appear to support the notion that women are more vulnerable to psychostimulant and opioid craving and relapse. However, this conclusion is tentative because most of the studies reviewed were correlational, not sufficiently powered, and/or not a priori designed to detect sex differences. Additionally, fMRI studies suggest sex differences in brain responses to cocaine cues and stress. The results of the preclinical studies reviewed provide evidence for sex differences in stress-induced reinstatement and incubation of cocaine craving, but not cue- or cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. These sex differences are modulated in part by ovarian hormones. In contrast, the available data do not support the notion of sex differences in craving and relapse/reinstatement for methamphetamine or heroin in rodent models. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundDespite the clear risks of tobacco use, millions of people continue to smoke. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), commonly called e-cigarettes, have been proposed as a substitute for those who are unwilling or unable to quit. Current systematic and narrative reviews on the health ]]>
<![CDATA[ effects of ENDS use, respiratory and cardiovascular effects in particular, have come to differing conclusions. ObjectiveThe purpose of our two systematic reviews is to critically assess and synthesize the available human studies on the respiratory and cardiovascular health effects of ENDS substitution for people who smoke. The primary goal is to provide clinicians with evidence on the health effects of ENDS substitution to inform their treatment recommendations and plans. The twin goal is to promote the health literacy of ENDS users with facts on the health effects of ENDS. A secondary goal is to develop policy briefs to provide governmental bodies with a preliminary assessment of the potential public health impacts of ENDS. MethodsThese two reviews will be living systematic reviews. The systematic reviews will be initiated with a baseline review. Studies will be evaluated with the JBI quality assessment tools and a checklist of biases drawn from the Centre for Evidence Based Medicines Catalogue of Bias. A narrative synthesis is planned due to the heterogeneity of data. A search for recently published studies will be conducted every three months, and an updated review published every six months for the duration of the project or possibly longer. ResultsThe baseline and updated reviews will be published in a peer review journal. The review findings will be reported in a white paper for clinicians, a fact sheet for people who use ENDS, and country-specific policy briefs. ConclusionsThe substitution of ENDS for cigarettes is one of the ways to potentially reduce the risks of smoking. Clinicians and their patients need to understand the potential benefits and possible risks of substituting ENDS for cigarettes. Our living systematic reviews seek to highlight the best and most up-to-date evidence in this highly contentious and fast-moving field of research. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundOral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are considered one of the most important birth control methods in the world. However, these pills were designed for female administration rather than males. This study was designed to investigate patterns of OCPs use and abuse among Jordanian males, according to the community pharmacists observations. MethodA mixed-method explanatory sequential study was conducted using an online self - administered survey and semi-structured in-depth interviews for community pharmacists. The interviews were utilized using a conceptual framework. Inductive thematic analysis and descriptive/regression analyses were completed using Nvivo and SPSS, respectively. ResultsA total of 158 questionnaire responses and 22 interviews were included in our analysis. Around half (48.4%) of the questionnaire responses confirmed that males could use OCPs for hair growth enhancement, muscle gain and acne treatment 12.7%, 31.7% and 4.4%, respectively. Through the interviews, the majority of the pharmacists highlighted that most of the males use OCPs for bodybuilding purposes, according to recommendations by their coaches at the gym. The most abused OCPs containing estrogen (Ethinyl estradiol) and progestins (Drospirenone or Levonorgestrel). ConclusionThis study provided insight into unexpected uses of OCPs by males in Jordan. Community pharmacists have a crucial role in the management of OCPs use and abuse, However, restricted regulations and monitoring must be released and implemented on the community to limit such practices. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ubjects into those with MDD (n=5,991), AUD (n=12,952), both (MDD+AUD)(n=3,219), and controls (n=25,663). We used generalized linear models (GLMs) to test whether rates of SD and sleep duration differed among the groups and determine the clinical predictors of SD. Rates of SD and sleep duration were compared using regression analyses accounting for demographic (age, sex, ethnicity, and Townsend deprivation index) and clinical (body mass index, neuroticism score, and alcohol consumption) factors. ResultsAfter accounting for diagnostic category, SD was associated with age, female sex, white ethnicity, and higher BMI, neuroticism and alcohol consumption scores (all p<0.0001). The unadjusted prevalence of SD was 25.6%, 25.9%, 39.2%, and 41.1% in control, AUD, MDD, and MDD+AUD categories respectively. Rates of SD in controls and AUD group as well as MDD alone and MDD+AUD did not differ in unadjusted models (p=0.45 and 0.075, respectively). Prevalence of SD differed in the four groups (p<0.0001 for all pairwise comparisons) after adjusting for demographic confounders. After further adjustment for clinical factors, effect sizes were reduced, but pairwise comparisons remained significant, except in the AUD versus MDD group (all p<0.05). After adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, sleep duration did not differ among the groups. ConclusionDemographic and clinical characteristics associated with SD were similar in patients with MDD, AUD, and MDD+AUD. The differences in rates of SD between the diagnostic groups were attenuated but persisted after accounting for these confounders. Genetic and other factors capable of influencing SD in patients with MDD, AUD, and comorbid MDD+AUD merit future investigation. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundA version of ketamine, called Esketamine has been approved for treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

<![CDATA[ l ketamine use and brain structural and functional alterations. We found dorsal prefrontal gray matter reduction in chronic ketamine users. It is unknown, however, whether these observations might parallel findings of cortical thickness alterations. This study aimed at exploring cortical thickness abnormalities following non-medical, long-term use of ketamine. MethodsStructural brain images were acquired for 95 patients with ketamine dependence, and 169 drug-free healthy controls. FreeSurfer software was used to measure cortical thickness for 68 brain regions. Cortical thickness was compared between the two groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with covariates of age, gender, educational level, smoking, drinking, and whole brain mean cortical thickness. Results were considered significant if the Bonferroni corrected P-value < 0.01. ResultsCompared to healthy controls, patients with ketamine dependence have widespread decreased cortical thickness, with the most extensive reductions in the frontal (including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC) and parietal (including the precuneus) lobes. Increased cortical thickness was not observed in ketamine users relative to comparison subjects. Estimated total lifetime ketamine consumption is correlated with the right inferior parietal and the right rostral middle frontal cortical thickness reductions. ConclusionsThis study provides first evidence that, compared with healthy controls, chronic ketamine users had cortical thickness reductions. ]]>

<![CDATA[ as a prospective cohort study. We used data from the third phase of the Shahroud eye cohort study on 4394 participants which started in September 2019 and ended before the COVID-19 epidemic in Shahroud in February 2020. The participants were followed for 10.5 months till November 2020. COVID-19 was detected by RT-PCR on swap samples from the oropharynx and nasopharynx. The incidence of COVID-19 compared in OUD and Non-OUD participants, and relative risk was calculated in Log Binomial Regression model. ResultsAmong the 4394 participants with a mean age of 61.1 years, 120 people had OUD. The incidence of COVID-19 in participants with OUD and Non-OUD were 3.3% and 4.5%, respectively. The relative risk of OUD for COVID-19 was 0.75 (95% Confidence intervals: 0.28 - 1.98; P= 0.555). ConclusionsOpioid use disorder was not associated with COVID-19. The claim that people with OUD are less likely to develop COVID-19 is not supported by this data. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ AimTo estimate changes in smoking, drinking, and quitting behaviour from before to during the first Covid-19 lockdown in England, and whether changes differed by age, sex, or social grade. DesignRepresentative cross-sectional surveys of adults, collected monthly between August 2018 and July 2020. SettingEngland. Participants36,980 adults ([&ge;]18y). MeasurementsIndependent variables were survey month (pre-lockdown: August-February vs. lockdown months: April-July) and year (pandemic: 2019/20 vs. comparator: 2018/19). Smoking outcomes were smoking prevalence, cessation, quit attempts, quit success, and use of evidence-based or remote cessation support. Drinking outcomes were high-risk drinking prevalence, alcohol reduction attempts, and use of evidence-based or remote support. Moderators were age, sex, and occupational social grade (ABC1=more advantaged/C2DE=less advantaged). FindingsRelative to changes over the same time period in 2018/19, lockdown was associated with significant increases in smoking prevalence (+24.7% in 2019/20 vs. 0.0% in 2018/19, ORadj=1.35[95%CI=1.12-1.63]) and quit attempts (+39.9% vs. -22.2%, ORadj=2.48[1.76-3.50]) among 18-34 year-olds, but not older groups. Increases in cessation (+156.4% vs. -12.5%, ORadj=3.08[1.86-5.09]) and the success rate of quit attempts (+99.2% vs. +0.8%, ORadj=2.29[1.31-3.98]) were also observed, and did not differ significantly by age, sex, or social grade. Lockdown was associated with a significant increase in high-risk drinking prevalence across all sociodemographic groups (+39.5% vs. -7.8%, ORadj=1.80[1.64-1.98]), with particularly high increases among women (ORadj=2.17[1.87-2.53]) and social grades C2DE (ORadj=2.34[2.00-2.74]). Alcohol reduction attempts increased significantly among high-risk drinkers from social grades ABC1 (ORadj=2.31[1.78-3.00]) but not C2DE (ORadj=1.25[0.83-1.88]), with larger increases among those aged 18-34 (ORadj=2.56[1.72-3.81]) and [&ge;]60 (ORadj=1.43[1.05-1.95]) than 35-59 (ORadj=2.51[1.51-4.18]). There were few significant changes in use of support for smoking cessation or alcohol reduction, although samples were small. ConclusionsIn England, the first Covid-19 lockdown was associated with increased smoking prevalence among younger adults, and increased high-risk drinking prevalence among all adults. Smoking cessation activity also increased: more younger smokers made quit attempts during lockdown and more smokers quit successfully. Socioeconomic disparities in drinking behaviour were evident: high-risk drinking increased by more among women and those from less advantaged social grades (C2DE) but the rate of reduction attempts increased only among the more advantaged social grades (ABC1). ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundObservational studies suggest smoking, cannabis use, alcohol consumption, cannabis use, and substance use disorders (SUDs) may play a role in the susceptibility for respiratory infections and disease, including coronavirus 2019 (COVID-2019). However, causal inference is challenging due to comorbid substance use. MethodsUsing genome-wide association study data of European ancestry (data from >1.7 million individuals), we performed single-variable and multivariable Mendelian randomization to evaluate relationships between smoking, cannabis use, alcohol consumption, SUDs, and respiratory infections. ResultsGenetically predicted lifetime smoking was found to be associated with increased risk for hospitalized COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR)=4.039, 95% CI 2.335-6.985, P-value=5.93x10-7) and very severe hospitalized COVID-19 (OR=3.091, 95% CI, 1.883-5.092, P-value=8.40x10-6). Genetically predicted lifetime smoking was also associated with increased risk pneumoniae (OR=1.589, 95% CI, 1.214-2.078, P-value=7.33x10-4), lower respiratory infections (OR=2.303, 95% CI, 1.713-3.097, P-value=3.40x10-8), and several others. Genetically predicted cannabis use disorder (CUD) was associated with increased bronchitis risk (OR=1.078, 95% CI, 1.020-1.128, P-value=0.007). ConclusionsWe provide strong genetic evidence showing smoking increases the risk for respiratory infections and diseases even after accounting for other substance use and abuse. Additionally, we provide find CUD may increase the risk for bronchitis, which taken together, may guide future research SUDs and respiratory outcomes. ]]>

<![CDATA[ cally availble human brain tissues (midbrain, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex neurons) from 71 individuals (mean age = 39.9, 100% male, 36 with CUD and 35 matched controls). We leveraged the L1000 database to investigate molecular associations between neuronal mRNA profiles from 825 repurposable compounds (e.g., FDA approved) with human CUD gene expression in the brain. We identified 16 compounds that were negatively associated with CUD gene expression patterns across all brain regions (padj < 0.05), all of which outperformed current targets undergoing clinical trials for CUD (all padj > 0.05). We tested the effectiveness of these compounds using independent transcriptome-wide in vitro (neuronal cocaine exposure; n=18) and in vivo (mouse cocaine self-administration; prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and midbrain; n = 12-15) datasets. Among these medications, Ibrutinib demonstrated negative associations with both neuronal cocaine exposure and mouse cocaine self-administration. To obtain experimental confirmation of therapeutic effects of Ibrutinib on CUD, we used the Drosophila melanogaster model, which enables highthroughput quantification of behavioral responses in defined genetic backgrounds and controlled environmental conditions. Ibrutinib altered cocaine-induced changes in startle response and reduced the occurrence of cocaine-induced seizures (n = 61-142 per group; sex: 51%female). Our results identify Ibrutinib, an FDA approved medication, as a potential therapeutic for cocaine neurotoxicity. ]]>

<![CDATA[ AimsThe study aimed to identify specific genes and functional genetic variants affecting susceptibility to two alcohol related phenotypes: heavy drinking and problem drinking. MethodsPhenotypic and exome sequence data was downloaded from the UK Biobank. Reported drinks in the last 24 hours was used to define heavy drinking while responses to a mental health questionnaire defined problem drinking. Gene-wise weighted burden analysis was applied, with genetic variants which were rarer and/or had a more severe functional effect being weighted more highly. Additionally, previously reported variants of interest were analysed inidividually. ResultsOf exome sequenced subjects, for heavy drinking there were 8,166 cases and 84,461 controls while for problem drinking there were 7,811 cases and 59,606 controls. No gene was formally significant after correction for multiple testing but three genes possibly related to autism were significant at p < 0.001, FOXP1, ARHGAP33 and CDH9, along with VGF which may also be of psychiatric interest. Well established associations with rs1229984 in ADH1B and rs671 in ALDH2 were confirmed but previously reported variants in ALDH1B1 and GRM3 were not associated with either phenotype. ConclusionsThis large study fails to conclusively implicate any novel genes or variants. It is possible that more definitive results will be obtained when sequence data for the remaining UK Biobank participants becomes available and/or if data can be obtained for a more extreme phenotype such as alcohol dependence disorder. This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource. Short summaryTests for association of rare, functional genetic variants with heavy drinking and problem drinking confirm the known effects of variants in ADH1B and ALDH2 but fail to implicate novel variants or genes. Results for three genes potentially related to autism suggest they might exert a protective effect. ]]>

<![CDATA[ from genetic liability to substance use, and its relation to genetic liability to impulsivity, negative affect, and executive function as well as non-substance psychopathology. MethodsWe tested whether a common genetic factor undergirds liability to problematic alcohol use (PAU), problematic tobacco use (PTU), cannabis use disorder (CUD), and opioid use disorder (OUD) by applying Genomic structural equation modelling to genome-wide association study statistics (Total N = 1,019,521; substance specific Ns range: 82,707-435,563 of European ancestry), while adjusting for the genetics of substance use (Ns = 184,765-632,802). We tested whether shared liability across SUDs is associated with behavioral constructs (risk taking, executive function, neuroticism; Ns = 328,339-427,037) and non-substance use psychopathology (mood/psychotic, compulsive, and early neurodevelopmental disorders). ResultsShared genetic liability to PAU, PTU, CUD, and OUD was characterized by a unidimensional addiction factor (termed a(g)), independent of substance use. OUD and CUD demonstrated the largest loadings. a(g) was associated with risk taking, neuroticism, executive function, and non-substance psychopathology, but retained specific variance (standardized residual= .579). InterpretationA common genetic addictions factor partly explains susceptibility for alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and opioid use disorder. a(g) has unique pathways that are not shared with substance use or non-substance psychopathology, suggesting that addiction is not the linear combination of substance use and psychopathology. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ BackgroundThe nicotine metabolite ratio and nicotine equivalents are measures of metabolism rate and intake. Genome-wide prediction of these nicotine biomarkers will extend biomarker studies to cohorts without measured biomarkers and enable tobacco-related behavioral and exposure research. MethodsWe screened genetic variants genome-wide using marginal scans and applied statistical learning algorithms on top-ranked genetic variants and age, ethnicity and sex, and cigarettes per day (CPD) (in additional modeling) to build prediction models for the urinary nicotine metabolite ratio (uNMR) and creatinine-standardized total nicotine equivalents (TNE) in 2,239 current cigarette smokers in five ethnic groups. We predicted these nicotine biomarkers using model ensembles, and evaluated external validity using behavioral outcomes in 1,864 treatment-seeking smokers in two ethnic groups. ResultsThe genomic regions with the most selected and trained variants for measured biomarkers were chr19q13.2 (uNMR, without and with CPD) and chr15q25.1 and chr10q25.3 (TNE, without and with CPD). We observed ensemble correlations between measured and predicted biomarker values for the uNMR and TNE without (with CPD) of 0.67 (0.68), and 0.65 (0.72) in the training sample. We observed inconsistency in penalized regression models of TNE (with CPD) with fewer variants at chr15q25.1 selected and trained. In treatment-seeking smokers, predicted uNMR (without CPD) was significantly associated with CPD, and predicted TNE (without CPD) with CPD, Time-To-First-Cigarette, and Fagerstrom total score. ConclusionsNicotine metabolites, genome-wide data and statistical learning approaches develop novel robust predictive models for urinary nicotine biomarkers in multiple ethnic groups. Predicted biomarker associations help define genetically-influenced components of nicotine dependence. IMPLICATIONSWe demonstrate development of robust models and multiethnic prediction of the urinary nicotine metabolite ratio and total nicotine equivalents using statistical and machine learning approaches. Trained variants in models for both biomarkers include top-ranked variants in multiethnic genome-wide studies of smoking behavior, nicotine metabolites and related disease. Association of the two predicted nicotine biomarkers with Fagerstr{square}m Test for Nicotine Dependence items support models of nicotine biomarkers as predictors of physical dependence and nicotine exposure. Predicted nicotine biomarkers may facilitate tobacco-related disease and treatment research in samples with genomic data and limited nicotine metabolite or tobacco exposure data. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ BackgroundRelapse is one of the most perplexing problems of addiction. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is crucially involved in numerous cognitive and affective processes that are implicated in phenotypes of addiction, and is one of the most frequently reported brain regions with aberrant functionality in substance use disorders. However, the DLPFC is an anatomically large and functionally heterogeneous region, and the specific DLPFC-based circuits that contribute to drug relapse remain unknown. MethodsWe systematically investigated the relationship of cocaine relapse with 98 DLPFC functional circuits defined by evenly sampling the entire bilateral DLPFC in a cohort of cocaine dependent patients (n=43, 5F) following a psychosocial treatment intervention. A Cox regression model was utilized to predict relapse likelihood based on DLPFC functional connectivity strength. ResultsFunctional connectivity from 3 of the 98 DLPFC loci, one on the left and two on the right hemisphere, significantly predicted cocaine relapse with an accuracy of 83.9%, 84.7% and 85.4%, respectively. Combining all three significantly improved prediction validity to 87.5%. Protective and risk circuits related to these DLPFC loci were identified that are known to support "bottom up" drive to use drug and "top down" control over behavior together with social emotional, learning and memory processing. ConclusionThree DLPFC-centric circuits were identified that predict relapse to cocaine use with high accuracy. These functionally distinct DLPFC-based circuits provide insights into the multiple roles played by the DLPFC in cognitive and affective functioning that affects treatment outcome. The identified DLPFC loci may serve as potential neuromodulation targets for addiction treatment and as clinically relevant biomarkers of its efficacy. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ Background and AimsThe 3-question Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) is commonly employed in healthcare to screen for levels of alcohol consumption. AUDIT-C scores (0-12) have no direct interpretation and do not provide information on alcohol intake, an important variable for behaviour change. The study aimed to (a) develop a continuous metric from the Extended AUDIT-C, offering equivalent accuracy, and providing a direct estimator of weekly alcohol consumption (EWAC); (b) evaluate the EWACs bias and error using the Graduated-Frequency (GF) questionnaire as a reference standard of alcohol consumption. DesignCross-sectional diagnostic study based on a nationally-representative survey. SettingsCommunity-dwelling households in England. Participants22,404 household residents aged [&ge;]16 years reporting drinking alcohol at least occasionally. MeasurementsComputer-assisted personal interviews consisting of (a) Extended AUDIT and (b) GF. The primary outcomes were: mean deviation <1 UK unit (metric of bias); root mean squared deviation <2 UK units (metric of total error) between EWAC and GF. The secondary outcome was an equivalent receiver operating characteristic area under the curve for predicting alcohol consumption in excess of 14 and 35 UK units compared to AUDIT-C and AUDIT. FindingsEWAC had a positive bias of 0.2 UK units [95% confidence interval: 0.04, 0.3] compared to GF. Deviations were skewed: while the mean error was {+/-}11 UK units/week [9.8, 12.0], in half of participants the deviation between EWAC and GF was between 0 and {+/-}2.1 UK units/week. EWAC predicted consumption in excess of 14 UK units/week with a significantly greater area under the curve (0.921 [0.917, 0.925]) than AUDIT-C (0.871 [0.866, 0.876]) or the full AUDIT (0.854 [0.849, 0.860]). ConclusionsThe EWAC https://ewac.netlify.app is designed to estimate weekly alcohol consumption using answers to the Extended AUDIT-C questionnaire. Using the detailed GF as a reference standard, the EWAC met the targeted bias tolerance. Its accuracy was superior to that of both AUDIT-C and the full AUDIT in relation to consumption thresholds, making it a reliable complement to the Extended AUDIT-C for health promotion interventions.

<![CDATA[ IntroductionAddiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. ResultsThere were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI= 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI= 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI= 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI= 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI =1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI= 5%, 13%). DiscussionOur novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Poly-drug consumption is a dangerous, yet complex model of substance use that contributes to many cases of imprisonment and fatal overdose. Despite the growing number of studies looking at this phenomenon, there remains a lack of neuroimaging data elucidating the neural markers of poly-drug use. In particular, the valuation system, tasked with weighing the value of items and experiences, may hold significance in understanding the motivations behind poly-drug use. To this end, we sought to analyze the functional connectivity of the Valuation System (VS), Executive Control System (ECS) and Valuation-Control Complex (VCC) of drug-using participants in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult dataset (n=992). Using multivariate regression, network-averaged connectivities were correlated with various substance use measures (stimulants, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates, sedatives and marijuana) and demographic variables (gender, parental use history). We found that the VS, ECS and VCC were all correlated with drug use behaviour either as individual systems or when paired with other substances. Both VS (R2= 0.53) and ECS (R2= 0.55) connectivity are positively correlated with stimulant use whereas both ECS (R2= 0.45) and VCC (R2= 0.045) connectivity are negatively correlated with marijuana use. VS (R2= 0.75) and VCC (R2= 0.74) connectivities are also negatively correlated with sedative use. Additionally, network connectivity was correlated with drug use behaviour via two-way interactions with other substances. These findings provide preliminary indications of the consequences of poly-drug use in healthy young adults. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in civilians and highly prevalent among military Servicemembers and in contact sports athletes. mTBI, especially within military populations, is often comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., sensation/novelty seeking, impulsivity, risk taking, irritability/aggression) and substance misuse/abuse, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an established mouse model of blast mTBI, here we examined the effects of single (1x) and repetitive (3x) blast exposure on ethanol responsivity using a battery of tests, each associated with distinct aspects of alcohol abuse vulnerability. While both single and repetitive blast exposure increased the sedative properties of high-dose ethanol (with no change in tolerance or metabolism), only repetitive blast exposure potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and shifted ethanol intake patterns (i.e., increased consumption front-loading) during intermittent two bottle choice. To establish translational relevance, we next examined self-report responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) and used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to investigate whether a history of blast with acute symptoms and mTBI affected drinking behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. AUDIT-C scores were increased in Veterans with a history of blast exposure and subsequent cluster analysis identified a three-cluster solution: low (low intake and low frequency), frequent (low intake but high frequency), and risky (high intake and high frequency), where Veterans with a history of blast mTBI displayed a shift in cluster assignment from frequent to risky, as compared to Veterans who were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan who had no lifetime history of TBI. Together, these results offer new insight regarding how blast mTBI may give rise to increased substance use/misuse and highlight the increased potential for adverse health-risk behaviors following repetitive blast mTBI exposure. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveMethadone is an evidence based treatment for opioid use disorder and is also employed for acute pain. The primary objective of this study was to explore methadone distribution patterns between the years 2017 and 2019 across the United States (US). This study builds upon previous literature ]]>
<![CDATA[ that has analyzed prior years of US distribution patterns, and further outlines regional and state specific methadone trends. MethodsThe Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) was used to acquire the number of narcotic treatment programs (NTPs) per state and methadone distribution weight in grams. Methadone distribution by weight, corrected for state populations, and number of NTPs were compared from 2017 to 2019 between states, within regions, and nationally. ResultsBetween 2017 and 2019, the national distribution of methadone increased 12.30% for NTPs but decreased 34.57% for pain, for a total increase of 2.66%. While all states saw a decrease in distribution for pain, when compared regionally, the Northeast showed a significantly smaller decrease than all other regions. Additionally, the majority of states experienced an increase in distribution for NTPs and most states demonstrated a relatively stable or increasing number of NTPs, with an 11.49% increase in NTPs nationally. The number of NTPs per 100K in 2019 ranged from 2.08 in Rhode Island to 0.00 in Wyoming. ConclusionAlthough methadone distribution for OUD was increasing in the US, there were pronounced regional disparities. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ BackgroundAlthough effective treatments exist, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is undertreated. We used a cascade of care framework to understand gaps in care between diagnosis and treatment for persons with AUD. MethodsUsing 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we evaluated the following steps in the cascade of care: 1) prevalence of adults with AUD; 2) proportion of adults who utilized health care in the past 12 months; 3) were screened about alcohol use; 4) received a brief intervention about alcohol misuse; 5) received information about treatment for alcohol misuse; and 6) proportion of persons with AUD who received treatment. Analyses were stratified by AUD severity. ResultsOf the 171,766 persons included in the sample, weighted prevalence of AUD was 7.9% (95% CI 7.7-8.0%). Persons with AUD utilized health care settings at similar rates as those without AUD. Cascades of care showed the majority of individuals with AUD utilized health care and were screened about alcohol use, but the percent who received the subsequent steps of care decreased substantially. For those with severe AUD, 83.5% (CI: 78.3%-88.7%) utilized health care in the past 12 months, 73.5% (CI: 68.1%-78.9%) were screened for alcohol use, 22.7% (CI: 19.4%-26.0%) received a brief intervention, 12.4% (CI: 10%-14.7%) received information about treatment, and 20.5% (CI: 18%-23.1%) were treated for AUD. The greatest decrease in the care continuum occurred from screening to brief intervention and referral to treatment. More persons with severe AUD received treatment than were referred, indicating other pathways to treatment outside of the healthcare system. ConclusionsPersons with AUD utilize health care at high rates and are frequently screened about alcohol use, but few receive treatment. Health care settings-particularly primary care settings-represent a prime opportunity to implement pharmacologic treatment for AUD to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by compulsive searching for cocaine that produces cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis whose aims to more accurately model micro-structural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. As hypothesized, we found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. Correlations between significant ROIs showed a dependency of impulsivity and years of cocaine consumption over Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white-matter, however their clinical relevance remains questionable. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Impaired inhibitory control accompanied by enhanced salience attributed to drug-related cues, both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functions, are hallmarks of drug addiction, contributing to worse symptomatology including craving. dlPFC modulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed craving reduction in inpatients with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results. In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive function including impulsivity. An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group, an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group x time interactions showed improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and craving. This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundMore than 20 million Americans ages 12 and older have a past-year substance use disorder. Majority-minority cities, including Flint, MI, suffer disproportionately from higher rates of substance use and are less likely to have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions relative to predominately White and wealthier cities. Thus, identifying approaches that can improve implementation of evidence-based substance use practices is a critical public health goal. In the current report, we provide a detailed protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the Strengthening Flint Families initiative, a community-based implementation study of a multi-level behavioral health intervention that includes peer recovery coaching, the Strengthening Families Program, and a multimedia campaign. Our goal is to improve family resilience and reduce behavioral health disparities in the Flint community, as an example of how this could be done in other communities. Our overall strategy includes community-informed implementation enhancements to increase adoption and sustainment of evidence-based behavioral health services. MethodsThis project has 4 phases that align with study aims-1) a systematic assessment of behavioral health organizations in the Flint Area to understand organizational needs and strengths in Flint; 2) tailoring implementation strategies for one individual-level evidence-based practice, peer recovery coaching, and one family-level evidence-based program, the Strengthening Families Program; 3) building capacity and promoting sustainability; and 4) evaluating primary (implementation) and secondary (effectiveness) outcomes. Implementation outcomes are derived from the RE-AIM framework and effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at the individual, family, and community levels. DiscussionUnderstanding and addressing the behavioral health organizational needs, strengths, and barriers to program adoption and referral in Flint offers great promise to strengthen the behavioral health network of providers serving Flint residents. Moreover, understanding barriers to accessing and implementing behavioral health services in low-resource communities may prove to be a valuable tool for discovering the most effective implementation methods tailored to specific organizations. These evidence informed approaches may prove useful for cities outside of Flint. Contributions to the literatureMore research is needed on how best to improve community capacity for substance use services, especially in low-income communities This study will examine implementation strategies for improving community adoption and sustainment of a multilevel suite of substance use interventions Study findings will contribute to improved community-wide implementation of evidence-based behavioral health services and increased access to and participation in these services in low-resource communities ]]>

<![CDATA[ AimsTo investigate: (1) alcohol use during the pandemic in the UK; and (2) the extent to which poor inhibitory control and/or stress were associated with any change in alcohol use or hazardous drinking. DesignCross-sectional online survey administered between 2 and 31 May 2020. SettingUK. Participants13,453 respondents aged 19 - 62 years comprising participants of four nationally representative birth cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62-years old). MeasurementsChange in alcohol use and risk of alcohol-related harm due to hazardous drinking and change in stress since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak; inhibitory control (impatience and risk-taking); and sociodemographic characteristics, including diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and key worker status. FindingsMost respondents reported consuming/feeling the same amount or less alcohol/stress. However, a significant minority, particularly among thirty-(29.08%) and fifty-year-olds (26.67%), reported drinking more, and between 32.23% and 45.02% of respondents reported feeling more stressed depending on cohort. Being female was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting heightened stress (OR19 = 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.20; OR30 = 1.93, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.70; OR50 = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.92; OR62 = 2.03, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.48). Stress was associated with hazardous drinking among 30-year-olds (OR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.28). Impatience was associated with both increased alcohol use (1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) and hazardous drinking (1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) among 19-year-olds. Risk-taking was associated with hazardous drinking for 30-year-olds (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). ConclusionsThese data highlight concerns about the UK governments stance on the essential nature of off-premises alcohol sales during the lockdown, particularly from a public health perspective, when considering those at risk of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveThe current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodData were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. ResultsTwitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. ConclusionsExposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted. ]]>

<![CDATA[ IntroductionAddiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. ResultsThere were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI= 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI= 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI= 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI= 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI =1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI= 5%, 13%). DiscussionOur novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Poly-drug consumption is a dangerous, yet complex model of substance use that contributes to many cases of imprisonment and fatal overdose. Despite the growing number of studies looking at this phenomenon, there remains a lack of neuroimaging data elucidating the neural markers of poly-drug use. In particular, the valuation system, tasked with weighing the value of items and experiences, may hold significance in understanding the motivations behind poly-drug use. To this end, we sought to analyze the functional connectivity of the Valuation System (VS), Executive Control System (ECS) and Valuation-Control Complex (VCC) of drug-using participants in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult dataset (n=992). Using multivariate regression, network-averaged connectivities were correlated with various substance use measures (stimulants, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates, sedatives and marijuana) and demographic variables (gender, parental use history). We found that the VS, ECS and VCC were all correlated with drug use behaviour either as individual systems or when paired with other substances. Both VS (R2= 0.53) and ECS (R2= 0.55) connectivity are positively correlated with stimulant use whereas both ECS (R2= 0.45) and VCC (R2= 0.045) connectivity are negatively correlated with marijuana use. VS (R2= 0.75) and VCC (R2= 0.74) connectivities are also negatively correlated with sedative use. Additionally, network connectivity was correlated with drug use behaviour via two-way interactions with other substances. These findings provide preliminary indications of the consequences of poly-drug use in healthy young adults. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in civilians and highly prevalent among military Servicemembers and in contact sports athletes. mTBI, especially within military populations, is often comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., sensation/novelty seeking, impulsivity, risk taking, irritability/aggression) and substance misuse/abuse, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an established mouse model of blast mTBI, here we examined the effects of single (1x) and repetitive (3x) blast exposure on ethanol responsivity using a battery of tests, each associated with distinct aspects of alcohol abuse vulnerability. While both single and repetitive blast exposure increased the sedative properties of high-dose ethanol (with no change in tolerance or metabolism), only repetitive blast exposure potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and shifted ethanol intake patterns (i.e., increased consumption front-loading) during intermittent two bottle choice. To establish translational relevance, we next examined self-report responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) and used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to investigate whether a history of blast with acute symptoms and mTBI affected drinking behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. AUDIT-C scores were increased in Veterans with a history of blast exposure and subsequent cluster analysis identified a three-cluster solution: low (low intake and low frequency), frequent (low intake but high frequency), and risky (high intake and high frequency), where Veterans with a history of blast mTBI displayed a shift in cluster assignment from frequent to risky, as compared to Veterans who were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan who had no lifetime history of TBI. Together, these results offer new insight regarding how blast mTBI may give rise to increased substance use/misuse and highlight the increased potential for adverse health-risk behaviors following repetitive blast mTBI exposure. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveMethadone is an evidence based treatment for opioid use disorder and is also employed for acute pain. The primary objective of this study was to explore methadone distribution patterns between the years 2017 and 2019 across the United States (US). This study builds upon previous literature ]]>
<![CDATA[ that has analyzed prior years of US distribution patterns, and further outlines regional and state specific methadone trends. MethodsThe Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) was used to acquire the number of narcotic treatment programs (NTPs) per state and methadone distribution weight in grams. Methadone distribution by weight, corrected for state populations, and number of NTPs were compared from 2017 to 2019 between states, within regions, and nationally. ResultsBetween 2017 and 2019, the national distribution of methadone increased 12.30% for NTPs but decreased 34.57% for pain, for a total increase of 2.66%. While all states saw a decrease in distribution for pain, when compared regionally, the Northeast showed a significantly smaller decrease than all other regions. Additionally, the majority of states experienced an increase in distribution for NTPs and most states demonstrated a relatively stable or increasing number of NTPs, with an 11.49% increase in NTPs nationally. The number of NTPs per 100K in 2019 ranged from 2.08 in Rhode Island to 0.00 in Wyoming. ConclusionAlthough methadone distribution for OUD was increasing in the US, there were pronounced regional disparities. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ BackgroundAlthough effective treatments exist, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is undertreated. We used a cascade of care framework to understand gaps in care between diagnosis and treatment for persons with AUD. MethodsUsing 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we evaluated the following steps in the cascade of care: 1) prevalence of adults with AUD; 2) proportion of adults who utilized health care in the past 12 months; 3) were screened about alcohol use; 4) received a brief intervention about alcohol misuse; 5) received information about treatment for alcohol misuse; and 6) proportion of persons with AUD who received treatment. Analyses were stratified by AUD severity. ResultsOf the 171,766 persons included in the sample, weighted prevalence of AUD was 7.9% (95% CI 7.7-8.0%). Persons with AUD utilized health care settings at similar rates as those without AUD. Cascades of care showed the majority of individuals with AUD utilized health care and were screened about alcohol use, but the percent who received the subsequent steps of care decreased substantially. For those with severe AUD, 83.5% (CI: 78.3%-88.7%) utilized health care in the past 12 months, 73.5% (CI: 68.1%-78.9%) were screened for alcohol use, 22.7% (CI: 19.4%-26.0%) received a brief intervention, 12.4% (CI: 10%-14.7%) received information about treatment, and 20.5% (CI: 18%-23.1%) were treated for AUD. The greatest decrease in the care continuum occurred from screening to brief intervention and referral to treatment. More persons with severe AUD received treatment than were referred, indicating other pathways to treatment outside of the healthcare system. ConclusionsPersons with AUD utilize health care at high rates and are frequently screened about alcohol use, but few receive treatment. Health care settings-particularly primary care settings-represent a prime opportunity to implement pharmacologic treatment for AUD to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by compulsive searching for cocaine that produces cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis whose aims to more accurately model micro-structural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. As hypothesized, we found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. Correlations between significant ROIs showed a dependency of impulsivity and years of cocaine consumption over Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white-matter, however their clinical relevance remains questionable. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Impaired inhibitory control accompanied by enhanced salience attributed to drug-related cues, both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functions, are hallmarks of drug addiction, contributing to worse symptomatology including craving. dlPFC modulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed craving reduction in inpatients with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results. In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive function including impulsivity. An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group, an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group x time interactions showed improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and craving. This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundMore than 20 million Americans ages 12 and older have a past-year substance use disorder. Majority-minority cities, including Flint, MI, suffer disproportionately from higher rates of substance use and are less likely to have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions relative to predominately White and wealthier cities. Thus, identifying approaches that can improve implementation of evidence-based substance use practices is a critical public health goal. In the current report, we provide a detailed protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the Strengthening Flint Families initiative, a community-based implementation study of a multi-level behavioral health intervention that includes peer recovery coaching, the Strengthening Families Program, and a multimedia campaign. Our goal is to improve family resilience and reduce behavioral health disparities in the Flint community, as an example of how this could be done in other communities. Our overall strategy includes community-informed implementation enhancements to increase adoption and sustainment of evidence-based behavioral health services. MethodsThis project has 4 phases that align with study aims-1) a systematic assessment of behavioral health organizations in the Flint Area to understand organizational needs and strengths in Flint; 2) tailoring implementation strategies for one individual-level evidence-based practice, peer recovery coaching, and one family-level evidence-based program, the Strengthening Families Program; 3) building capacity and promoting sustainability; and 4) evaluating primary (implementation) and secondary (effectiveness) outcomes. Implementation outcomes are derived from the RE-AIM framework and effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at the individual, family, and community levels. DiscussionUnderstanding and addressing the behavioral health organizational needs, strengths, and barriers to program adoption and referral in Flint offers great promise to strengthen the behavioral health network of providers serving Flint residents. Moreover, understanding barriers to accessing and implementing behavioral health services in low-resource communities may prove to be a valuable tool for discovering the most effective implementation methods tailored to specific organizations. These evidence informed approaches may prove useful for cities outside of Flint. Contributions to the literatureMore research is needed on how best to improve community capacity for substance use services, especially in low-income communities This study will examine implementation strategies for improving community adoption and sustainment of a multilevel suite of substance use interventions Study findings will contribute to improved community-wide implementation of evidence-based behavioral health services and increased access to and participation in these services in low-resource communities ]]>

<![CDATA[ AimsTo investigate: (1) alcohol use during the pandemic in the UK; and (2) the extent to which poor inhibitory control and/or stress were associated with any change in alcohol use or hazardous drinking. DesignCross-sectional online survey administered between 2 and 31 May 2020. SettingUK. Participants13,453 respondents aged 19 - 62 years comprising participants of four nationally representative birth cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62-years old). MeasurementsChange in alcohol use and risk of alcohol-related harm due to hazardous drinking and change in stress since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak; inhibitory control (impatience and risk-taking); and sociodemographic characteristics, including diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and key worker status. FindingsMost respondents reported consuming/feeling the same amount or less alcohol/stress. However, a significant minority, particularly among thirty-(29.08%) and fifty-year-olds (26.67%), reported drinking more, and between 32.23% and 45.02% of respondents reported feeling more stressed depending on cohort. Being female was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting heightened stress (OR19 = 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.20; OR30 = 1.93, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.70; OR50 = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.92; OR62 = 2.03, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.48). Stress was associated with hazardous drinking among 30-year-olds (OR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.28). Impatience was associated with both increased alcohol use (1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) and hazardous drinking (1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) among 19-year-olds. Risk-taking was associated with hazardous drinking for 30-year-olds (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). ConclusionsThese data highlight concerns about the UK governments stance on the essential nature of off-premises alcohol sales during the lockdown, particularly from a public health perspective, when considering those at risk of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveThe current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodData were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. ResultsTwitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. ConclusionsExposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted. ]]>

<![CDATA[ IntroductionAddiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. ResultsThere were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI= 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI= 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI= 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI= 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI =1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI= 5%, 13%). DiscussionOur novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Poly-drug consumption is a dangerous, yet complex model of substance use that contributes to many cases of imprisonment and fatal overdose. Despite the growing number of studies looking at this phenomenon, there remains a lack of neuroimaging data elucidating the neural markers of poly-drug use. In particular, the valuation system, tasked with weighing the value of items and experiences, may hold significance in understanding the motivations behind poly-drug use. To this end, we sought to analyze the functional connectivity of the Valuation System (VS), Executive Control System (ECS) and Valuation-Control Complex (VCC) of drug-using participants in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult dataset (n=992). Using multivariate regression, network-averaged connectivities were correlated with various substance use measures (stimulants, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates, sedatives and marijuana) and demographic variables (gender, parental use history). We found that the VS, ECS and VCC were all correlated with drug use behaviour either as individual systems or when paired with other substances. Both VS (R2= 0.53) and ECS (R2= 0.55) connectivity are positively correlated with stimulant use whereas both ECS (R2= 0.45) and VCC (R2= 0.045) connectivity are negatively correlated with marijuana use. VS (R2= 0.75) and VCC (R2= 0.74) connectivities are also negatively correlated with sedative use. Additionally, network connectivity was correlated with drug use behaviour via two-way interactions with other substances. These findings provide preliminary indications of the consequences of poly-drug use in healthy young adults. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in civilians and highly prevalent among military Servicemembers and in contact sports athletes. mTBI, especially within military populations, is often comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., sensation/novelty seeking, impulsivity, risk taking, irritability/aggression) and substance misuse/abuse, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an established mouse model of blast mTBI, here we examined the effects of single (1x) and repetitive (3x) blast exposure on ethanol responsivity using a battery of tests, each associated with distinct aspects of alcohol abuse vulnerability. While both single and repetitive blast exposure increased the sedative properties of high-dose ethanol (with no change in tolerance or metabolism), only repetitive blast exposure potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and shifted ethanol intake patterns (i.e., increased consumption front-loading) during intermittent two bottle choice. To establish translational relevance, we next examined self-report responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) and used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to investigate whether a history of blast with acute symptoms and mTBI affected drinking behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. AUDIT-C scores were increased in Veterans with a history of blast exposure and subsequent cluster analysis identified a three-cluster solution: low (low intake and low frequency), frequent (low intake but high frequency), and risky (high intake and high frequency), where Veterans with a history of blast mTBI displayed a shift in cluster assignment from frequent to risky, as compared to Veterans who were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan who had no lifetime history of TBI. Together, these results offer new insight regarding how blast mTBI may give rise to increased substance use/misuse and highlight the increased potential for adverse health-risk behaviors following repetitive blast mTBI exposure. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveMethadone is an evidence based treatment for opioid use disorder and is also employed for acute pain. The primary objective of this study was to explore methadone distribution patterns between the years 2017 and 2019 across the United States (US). This study builds upon previous literature ]]>
<![CDATA[ that has analyzed prior years of US distribution patterns, and further outlines regional and state specific methadone trends. MethodsThe Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) was used to acquire the number of narcotic treatment programs (NTPs) per state and methadone distribution weight in grams. Methadone distribution by weight, corrected for state populations, and number of NTPs were compared from 2017 to 2019 between states, within regions, and nationally. ResultsBetween 2017 and 2019, the national distribution of methadone increased 12.30% for NTPs but decreased 34.57% for pain, for a total increase of 2.66%. While all states saw a decrease in distribution for pain, when compared regionally, the Northeast showed a significantly smaller decrease than all other regions. Additionally, the majority of states experienced an increase in distribution for NTPs and most states demonstrated a relatively stable or increasing number of NTPs, with an 11.49% increase in NTPs nationally. The number of NTPs per 100K in 2019 ranged from 2.08 in Rhode Island to 0.00 in Wyoming. ConclusionAlthough methadone distribution for OUD was increasing in the US, there were pronounced regional disparities. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundAlthough effective treatments exist, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is undertreated. We used a cascade of care framework to understand gaps in care between diagnosis and treatment for persons with AUD. MethodsUsing 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we evaluated the following steps in the cascade of care: 1) prevalence of adults with AUD; 2) proportion of adults who utilized health care in the past 12 months; 3) were screened about alcohol use; 4) received a brief intervention about alcohol misuse; 5) received information about treatment for alcohol misuse; and 6) proportion of persons with AUD who received treatment. Analyses were stratified by AUD severity. ResultsOf the 171,766 persons included in the sample, weighted prevalence of AUD was 7.9% (95% CI 7.7-8.0%). Persons with AUD utilized health care settings at similar rates as those without AUD. Cascades of care showed the majority of individuals with AUD utilized health care and were screened about alcohol use, but the percent who received the subsequent steps of care decreased substantially. For those with severe AUD, 83.5% (CI: 78.3%-88.7%) utilized health care in the past 12 months, 73.5% (CI: 68.1%-78.9%) were screened for alcohol use, 22.7% (CI: 19.4%-26.0%) received a brief intervention, 12.4% (CI: 10%-14.7%) received information about treatment, and 20.5% (CI: 18%-23.1%) were treated for AUD. The greatest decrease in the care continuum occurred from screening to brief intervention and referral to treatment. More persons with severe AUD received treatment than were referred, indicating other pathways to treatment outside of the healthcare system. ConclusionsPersons with AUD utilize health care at high rates and are frequently screened about alcohol use, but few receive treatment. Health care settings-particularly primary care settings-represent a prime opportunity to implement pharmacologic treatment for AUD to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by compulsive searching for cocaine that produces cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis whose aims to more accurately model micro-structural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. As hypothesized, we found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. Correlations between significant ROIs showed a dependency of impulsivity and years of cocaine consumption over Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white-matter, however their clinical relevance remains questionable. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Impaired inhibitory control accompanied by enhanced salience attributed to drug-related cues, both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functions, are hallmarks of drug addiction, contributing to worse symptomatology including craving. dlPFC modulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed craving reduction in inpatients with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results. In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive function including impulsivity. An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group, an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group x time interactions showed improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and craving. This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ BackgroundMore than 20 million Americans ages 12 and older have a past-year substance use disorder. Majority-minority cities, including Flint, MI, suffer disproportionately from higher rates of substance use and are less likely to have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions relative to predominately White and wealthier cities. Thus, identifying approaches that can improve implementation of evidence-based substance use practices is a critical public health goal. In the current report, we provide a detailed protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the Strengthening Flint Families initiative, a community-based implementation study of a multi-level behavioral health intervention that includes peer recovery coaching, the Strengthening Families Program, and a multimedia campaign. Our goal is to improve family resilience and reduce behavioral health disparities in the Flint community, as an example of how this could be done in other communities. Our overall strategy includes community-informed implementation enhancements to increase adoption and sustainment of evidence-based behavioral health services. MethodsThis project has 4 phases that align with study aims-1) a systematic assessment of behavioral health organizations in the Flint Area to understand organizational needs and strengths in Flint; 2) tailoring implementation strategies for one individual-level evidence-based practice, peer recovery coaching, and one family-level evidence-based program, the Strengthening Families Program; 3) building capacity and promoting sustainability; and 4) evaluating primary (implementation) and secondary (effectiveness) outcomes. Implementation outcomes are derived from the RE-AIM framework and effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at the individual, family, and community levels. DiscussionUnderstanding and addressing the behavioral health organizational needs, strengths, and barriers to program adoption and referral in Flint offers great promise to strengthen the behavioral health network of providers serving Flint residents. Moreover, understanding barriers to accessing and implementing behavioral health services in low-resource communities may prove to be a valuable tool for discovering the most effective implementation methods tailored to specific organizations. These evidence informed approaches may prove useful for cities outside of Flint. Contributions to the literatureMore research is needed on how best to improve community capacity for substance use services, especially in low-income communities This study will examine implementation strategies for improving community adoption and sustainment of a multilevel suite of substance use interventions Study findings will contribute to improved community-wide implementation of evidence-based behavioral health services and increased access to and participation in these services in low-resource communities ]]>

<![CDATA[ AimsTo investigate: (1) alcohol use during the pandemic in the UK; and (2) the extent to which poor inhibitory control and/or stress were associated with any change in alcohol use or hazardous drinking. DesignCross-sectional online survey administered between 2 and 31 May 2020. SettingUK. Participants13,453 respondents aged 19 - 62 years comprising participants of four nationally representative birth cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62-years old). MeasurementsChange in alcohol use and risk of alcohol-related harm due to hazardous drinking and change in stress since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak; inhibitory control (impatience and risk-taking); and sociodemographic characteristics, including diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and key worker status. FindingsMost respondents reported consuming/feeling the same amount or less alcohol/stress. However, a significant minority, particularly among thirty-(29.08%) and fifty-year-olds (26.67%), reported drinking more, and between 32.23% and 45.02% of respondents reported feeling more stressed depending on cohort. Being female was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting heightened stress (OR19 = 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.20; OR30 = 1.93, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.70; OR50 = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.92; OR62 = 2.03, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.48). Stress was associated with hazardous drinking among 30-year-olds (OR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.28). Impatience was associated with both increased alcohol use (1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) and hazardous drinking (1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) among 19-year-olds. Risk-taking was associated with hazardous drinking for 30-year-olds (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). ConclusionsThese data highlight concerns about the UK governments stance on the essential nature of off-premises alcohol sales during the lockdown, particularly from a public health perspective, when considering those at risk of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveThe current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodData were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. ResultsTwitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. ConclusionsExposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted. ]]>

<![CDATA[ IntroductionAddiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. ResultsThere were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI= 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI= 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI= 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI= 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI =1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI= 5%, 13%). DiscussionOur novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Poly-drug consumption is a dangerous, yet complex model of substance use that contributes to many cases of imprisonment and fatal overdose. Despite the growing number of studies looking at this phenomenon, there remains a lack of neuroimaging data elucidating the neural markers of poly-drug use. In particular, the valuation system, tasked with weighing the value of items and experiences, may hold significance in understanding the motivations behind poly-drug use. To this end, we sought to analyze the functional connectivity of the Valuation System (VS), Executive Control System (ECS) and Valuation-Control Complex (VCC) of drug-using participants in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult dataset (n=992). Using multivariate regression, network-averaged connectivities were correlated with various substance use measures (stimulants, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates, sedatives and marijuana) and demographic variables (gender, parental use history). We found that the VS, ECS and VCC were all correlated with drug use behaviour either as individual systems or when paired with other substances. Both VS (R2= 0.53) and ECS (R2= 0.55) connectivity are positively correlated with stimulant use whereas both ECS (R2= 0.45) and VCC (R2= 0.045) connectivity are negatively correlated with marijuana use. VS (R2= 0.75) and VCC (R2= 0.74) connectivities are also negatively correlated with sedative use. Additionally, network connectivity was correlated with drug use behaviour via two-way interactions with other substances. These findings provide preliminary indications of the consequences of poly-drug use in healthy young adults. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in civilians and highly prevalent among military Servicemembers and in contact sports athletes. mTBI, especially within military populations, is often comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., sensation/novelty seeking, impulsivity, risk taking, irritability/aggression) and substance misuse/abuse, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an established mouse model of blast mTBI, here we examined the effects of single (1x) and repetitive (3x) blast exposure on ethanol responsivity using a battery of tests, each associated with distinct aspects of alcohol abuse vulnerability. While both single and repetitive blast exposure increased the sedative properties of high-dose ethanol (with no change in tolerance or metabolism), only repetitive blast exposure potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and shifted ethanol intake patterns (i.e., increased consumption front-loading) during intermittent two bottle choice. To establish translational relevance, we next examined self-report responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) and used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to investigate whether a history of blast with acute symptoms and mTBI affected drinking behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. AUDIT-C scores were increased in Veterans with a history of blast exposure and subsequent cluster analysis identified a three-cluster solution: low (low intake and low frequency), frequent (low intake but high frequency), and risky (high intake and high frequency), where Veterans with a history of blast mTBI displayed a shift in cluster assignment from frequent to risky, as compared to Veterans who were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan who had no lifetime history of TBI. Together, these results offer new insight regarding how blast mTBI may give rise to increased substance use/misuse and highlight the increased potential for adverse health-risk behaviors following repetitive blast mTBI exposure. ]]>

<![CDATA[ that has analyzed prior years of US distribution patterns, and further outlines regional and state specific methadone trends. MethodsThe Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) was used to acquire the number of narcotic treatment programs (NTPs) per state and methadone distribution weight in grams. Methadone distribution by weight, corrected for state populations, and number of NTPs were compared from 2017 to 2019 between states, within regions, and nationally. ResultsBetween 2017 and 2019, the national distribution of methadone increased 12.30% for NTPs but decreased 34.57% for pain, for a total increase of 2.66%. While all states saw a decrease in distribution for pain, when compared regionally, the Northeast showed a significantly smaller decrease than all other regions. Additionally, the majority of states experienced an increase in distribution for NTPs and most states demonstrated a relatively stable or increasing number of NTPs, with an 11.49% increase in NTPs nationally. The number of NTPs per 100K in 2019 ranged from 2.08 in Rhode Island to 0.00 in Wyoming. ConclusionAlthough methadone distribution for OUD was increasing in the US, there were pronounced regional disparities. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ BackgroundAlthough effective treatments exist, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is undertreated. We used a cascade of care framework to understand gaps in care between diagnosis and treatment for persons with AUD. MethodsUsing 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we evaluated the following steps in the cascade of care: 1) prevalence of adults with AUD; 2) proportion of adults who utilized health care in the past 12 months; 3) were screened about alcohol use; 4) received a brief intervention about alcohol misuse; 5) received information about treatment for alcohol misuse; and 6) proportion of persons with AUD who received treatment. Analyses were stratified by AUD severity. ResultsOf the 171,766 persons included in the sample, weighted prevalence of AUD was 7.9% (95% CI 7.7-8.0%). Persons with AUD utilized health care settings at similar rates as those without AUD. Cascades of care showed the majority of individuals with AUD utilized health care and were screened about alcohol use, but the percent who received the subsequent steps of care decreased substantially. For those with severe AUD, 83.5% (CI: 78.3%-88.7%) utilized health care in the past 12 months, 73.5% (CI: 68.1%-78.9%) were screened for alcohol use, 22.7% (CI: 19.4%-26.0%) received a brief intervention, 12.4% (CI: 10%-14.7%) received information about treatment, and 20.5% (CI: 18%-23.1%) were treated for AUD. The greatest decrease in the care continuum occurred from screening to brief intervention and referral to treatment. More persons with severe AUD received treatment than were referred, indicating other pathways to treatment outside of the healthcare system. ConclusionsPersons with AUD utilize health care at high rates and are frequently screened about alcohol use, but few receive treatment. Health care settings-particularly primary care settings-represent a prime opportunity to implement pharmacologic treatment for AUD to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by compulsive searching for cocaine that produces cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis whose aims to more accurately model micro-structural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. As hypothesized, we found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. Correlations between significant ROIs showed a dependency of impulsivity and years of cocaine consumption over Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white-matter, however their clinical relevance remains questionable. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Impaired inhibitory control accompanied by enhanced salience attributed to drug-related cues, both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functions, are hallmarks of drug addiction, contributing to worse symptomatology including craving. dlPFC modulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed craving reduction in inpatients with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results. In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive function including impulsivity. An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group, an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group x time interactions showed improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and craving. This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundMore than 20 million Americans ages 12 and older have a past-year substance use disorder. Majority-minority cities, including Flint, MI, suffer disproportionately from higher rates of substance use and are less likely to have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions relative to predominately White and wealthier cities. Thus, identifying approaches that can improve implementation of evidence-based substance use practices is a critical public health goal. In the current report, we provide a detailed protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the Strengthening Flint Families initiative, a community-based implementation study of a multi-level behavioral health intervention that includes peer recovery coaching, the Strengthening Families Program, and a multimedia campaign. Our goal is to improve family resilience and reduce behavioral health disparities in the Flint community, as an example of how this could be done in other communities. Our overall strategy includes community-informed implementation enhancements to increase adoption and sustainment of evidence-based behavioral health services. MethodsThis project has 4 phases that align with study aims-1) a systematic assessment of behavioral health organizations in the Flint Area to understand organizational needs and strengths in Flint; 2) tailoring implementation strategies for one individual-level evidence-based practice, peer recovery coaching, and one family-level evidence-based program, the Strengthening Families Program; 3) building capacity and promoting sustainability; and 4) evaluating primary (implementation) and secondary (effectiveness) outcomes. Implementation outcomes are derived from the RE-AIM framework and effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at the individual, family, and community levels. DiscussionUnderstanding and addressing the behavioral health organizational needs, strengths, and barriers to program adoption and referral in Flint offers great promise to strengthen the behavioral health network of providers serving Flint residents. Moreover, understanding barriers to accessing and implementing behavioral health services in low-resource communities may prove to be a valuable tool for discovering the most effective implementation methods tailored to specific organizations. These evidence informed approaches may prove useful for cities outside of Flint. Contributions to the literatureMore research is needed on how best to improve community capacity for substance use services, especially in low-income communities This study will examine implementation strategies for improving community adoption and sustainment of a multilevel suite of substance use interventions Study findings will contribute to improved community-wide implementation of evidence-based behavioral health services and increased access to and participation in these services in low-resource communities ]]>

<![CDATA[ AimsTo investigate: (1) alcohol use during the pandemic in the UK; and (2) the extent to which poor inhibitory control and/or stress were associated with any change in alcohol use or hazardous drinking. DesignCross-sectional online survey administered between 2 and 31 May 2020. SettingUK. Participants13,453 respondents aged 19 - 62 years comprising participants of four nationally representative birth cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62-years old). MeasurementsChange in alcohol use and risk of alcohol-related harm due to hazardous drinking and change in stress since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak; inhibitory control (impatience and risk-taking); and sociodemographic characteristics, including diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and key worker status. FindingsMost respondents reported consuming/feeling the same amount or less alcohol/stress. However, a significant minority, particularly among thirty-(29.08%) and fifty-year-olds (26.67%), reported drinking more, and between 32.23% and 45.02% of respondents reported feeling more stressed depending on cohort. Being female was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting heightened stress (OR19 = 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.20; OR30 = 1.93, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.70; OR50 = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.92; OR62 = 2.03, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.48). Stress was associated with hazardous drinking among 30-year-olds (OR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.28). Impatience was associated with both increased alcohol use (1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) and hazardous drinking (1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) among 19-year-olds. Risk-taking was associated with hazardous drinking for 30-year-olds (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). ConclusionsThese data highlight concerns about the UK governments stance on the essential nature of off-premises alcohol sales during the lockdown, particularly from a public health perspective, when considering those at risk of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveThe current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodData were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. ResultsTwitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. ConclusionsExposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted. ]]>

<![CDATA[ IntroductionAddiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. ResultsThere were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI= 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI= 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI= 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI= 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI =1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI= 5%, 13%). DiscussionOur novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Poly-drug consumption is a dangerous, yet complex model of substance use that contributes to many cases of imprisonment and fatal overdose. Despite the growing number of studies looking at this phenomenon, there remains a lack of neuroimaging data elucidating the neural markers of poly-drug use. In particular, the valuation system, tasked with weighing the value of items and experiences, may hold significance in understanding the motivations behind poly-drug use. To this end, we sought to analyze the functional connectivity of the Valuation System (VS), Executive Control System (ECS) and Valuation-Control Complex (VCC) of drug-using participants in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult dataset (n=992). Using multivariate regression, network-averaged connectivities were correlated with various substance use measures (stimulants, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates, sedatives and marijuana) and demographic variables (gender, parental use history). We found that the VS, ECS and VCC were all correlated with drug use behaviour either as individual systems or when paired with other substances. Both VS (R2= 0.53) and ECS (R2= 0.55) connectivity are positively correlated with stimulant use whereas both ECS (R2= 0.45) and VCC (R2= 0.045) connectivity are negatively correlated with marijuana use. VS (R2= 0.75) and VCC (R2= 0.74) connectivities are also negatively correlated with sedative use. Additionally, network connectivity was correlated with drug use behaviour via two-way interactions with other substances. These findings provide preliminary indications of the consequences of poly-drug use in healthy young adults. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in civilians and highly prevalent among military Servicemembers and in contact sports athletes. mTBI, especially within military populations, is often comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., sensation/novelty seeking, impulsivity, risk taking, irritability/aggression) and substance misuse/abuse, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an established mouse model of blast mTBI, here we examined the effects of single (1x) and repetitive (3x) blast exposure on ethanol responsivity using a battery of tests, each associated with distinct aspects of alcohol abuse vulnerability. While both single and repetitive blast exposure increased the sedative properties of high-dose ethanol (with no change in tolerance or metabolism), only repetitive blast exposure potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and shifted ethanol intake patterns (i.e., increased consumption front-loading) during intermittent two bottle choice. To establish translational relevance, we next examined self-report responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) and used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to investigate whether a history of blast with acute symptoms and mTBI affected drinking behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. AUDIT-C scores were increased in Veterans with a history of blast exposure and subsequent cluster analysis identified a three-cluster solution: low (low intake and low frequency), frequent (low intake but high frequency), and risky (high intake and high frequency), where Veterans with a history of blast mTBI displayed a shift in cluster assignment from frequent to risky, as compared to Veterans who were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan who had no lifetime history of TBI. Together, these results offer new insight regarding how blast mTBI may give rise to increased substance use/misuse and highlight the increased potential for adverse health-risk behaviors following repetitive blast mTBI exposure. ]]>

<![CDATA[ that has analyzed prior years of US distribution patterns, and further outlines regional and state specific methadone trends. MethodsThe Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) was used to acquire the number of narcotic treatment programs (NTPs) per state and methadone distribution weight in grams. Methadone distribution by weight, corrected for state populations, and number of NTPs were compared from 2017 to 2019 between states, within regions, and nationally. ResultsBetween 2017 and 2019, the national distribution of methadone increased 12.30% for NTPs but decreased 34.57% for pain, for a total increase of 2.66%. While all states saw a decrease in distribution for pain, when compared regionally, the Northeast showed a significantly smaller decrease than all other regions. Additionally, the majority of states experienced an increase in distribution for NTPs and most states demonstrated a relatively stable or increasing number of NTPs, with an 11.49% increase in NTPs nationally. The number of NTPs per 100K in 2019 ranged from 2.08 in Rhode Island to 0.00 in Wyoming. ConclusionAlthough methadone distribution for OUD was increasing in the US, there were pronounced regional disparities. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ BackgroundAlthough effective treatments exist, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is undertreated. We used a cascade of care framework to understand gaps in care between diagnosis and treatment for persons with AUD. MethodsUsing 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we evaluated the following steps in the cascade of care: 1) prevalence of adults with AUD; 2) proportion of adults who utilized health care in the past 12 months; 3) were screened about alcohol use; 4) received a brief intervention about alcohol misuse; 5) received information about treatment for alcohol misuse; and 6) proportion of persons with AUD who received treatment. Analyses were stratified by AUD severity. ResultsOf the 171,766 persons included in the sample, weighted prevalence of AUD was 7.9% (95% CI 7.7-8.0%). Persons with AUD utilized health care settings at similar rates as those without AUD. Cascades of care showed the majority of individuals with AUD utilized health care and were screened about alcohol use, but the percent who received the subsequent steps of care decreased substantially. For those with severe AUD, 83.5% (CI: 78.3%-88.7%) utilized health care in the past 12 months, 73.5% (CI: 68.1%-78.9%) were screened for alcohol use, 22.7% (CI: 19.4%-26.0%) received a brief intervention, 12.4% (CI: 10%-14.7%) received information about treatment, and 20.5% (CI: 18%-23.1%) were treated for AUD. The greatest decrease in the care continuum occurred from screening to brief intervention and referral to treatment. More persons with severe AUD received treatment than were referred, indicating other pathways to treatment outside of the healthcare system. ConclusionsPersons with AUD utilize health care at high rates and are frequently screened about alcohol use, but few receive treatment. Health care settings-particularly primary care settings-represent a prime opportunity to implement pharmacologic treatment for AUD to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by compulsive searching for cocaine that produces cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis whose aims to more accurately model micro-structural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. As hypothesized, we found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. Correlations between significant ROIs showed a dependency of impulsivity and years of cocaine consumption over Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white-matter, however their clinical relevance remains questionable. ]]>

Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results. In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive function including impulsivity. An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group, an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group x time interactions showed improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and craving. This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundMore than 20 million Americans ages 12 and older have a past-year substance use disorder. Majority-minority cities, including Flint, MI, suffer disproportionately from higher rates of substance use and are less likely to have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions relative to predominately White and wealthier cities. Thus, identifying approaches that can improve implementation of evidence-based substance use practices is a critical public health goal. In the current report, we provide a detailed protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the Strengthening Flint Families initiative, a community-based implementation study of a multi-level behavioral health intervention that includes peer recovery coaching, the Strengthening Families Program, and a multimedia campaign. Our goal is to improve family resilience and reduce behavioral health disparities in the Flint community, as an example of how this could be done in other communities. Our overall strategy includes community-informed implementation enhancements to increase adoption and sustainment of evidence-based behavioral health services. MethodsThis project has 4 phases that align with study aims-1) a systematic assessment of behavioral health organizations in the Flint Area to understand organizational needs and strengths in Flint; 2) tailoring implementation strategies for one individual-level evidence-based practice, peer recovery coaching, and one family-level evidence-based program, the Strengthening Families Program; 3) building capacity and promoting sustainability; and 4) evaluating primary (implementation) and secondary (effectiveness) outcomes. Implementation outcomes are derived from the RE-AIM framework and effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at the individual, family, and community levels. DiscussionUnderstanding and addressing the behavioral health organizational needs, strengths, and barriers to program adoption and referral in Flint offers great promise to strengthen the behavioral health network of providers serving Flint residents. Moreover, understanding barriers to accessing and implementing behavioral health services in low-resource communities may prove to be a valuable tool for discovering the most effective implementation methods tailored to specific organizations. These evidence informed approaches may prove useful for cities outside of Flint. Contributions to the literatureMore research is needed on how best to improve community capacity for substance use services, especially in low-income communities This study will examine implementation strategies for improving community adoption and sustainment of a multilevel suite of substance use interventions Study findings will contribute to improved community-wide implementation of evidence-based behavioral health services and increased access to and participation in these services in low-resource communities ]]>

<![CDATA[ AimsTo investigate: (1) alcohol use during the pandemic in the UK; and (2) the extent to which poor inhibitory control and/or stress were associated with any change in alcohol use or hazardous drinking. DesignCross-sectional online survey administered between 2 and 31 May 2020. SettingUK. Participants13,453 respondents aged 19 - 62 years comprising participants of four nationally representative birth cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62-years old). MeasurementsChange in alcohol use and risk of alcohol-related harm due to hazardous drinking and change in stress since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak; inhibitory control (impatience and risk-taking); and sociodemographic characteristics, including diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and key worker status. FindingsMost respondents reported consuming/feeling the same amount or less alcohol/stress. However, a significant minority, particularly among thirty-(29.08%) and fifty-year-olds (26.67%), reported drinking more, and between 32.23% and 45.02% of respondents reported feeling more stressed depending on cohort. Being female was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting heightened stress (OR19 = 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.20; OR30 = 1.93, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.70; OR50 = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.92; OR62 = 2.03, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.48). Stress was associated with hazardous drinking among 30-year-olds (OR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.28). Impatience was associated with both increased alcohol use (1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) and hazardous drinking (1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) among 19-year-olds. Risk-taking was associated with hazardous drinking for 30-year-olds (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). ConclusionsThese data highlight concerns about the UK governments stance on the essential nature of off-premises alcohol sales during the lockdown, particularly from a public health perspective, when considering those at risk of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveThe current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodData were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. ResultsTwitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. ConclusionsExposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted. ]]>

<![CDATA[ IntroductionAddiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. ResultsThere were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI= 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI= 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI= 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI= 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI =1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI= 5%, 13%). DiscussionOur novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Poly-drug consumption is a dangerous, yet complex model of substance use that contributes to many cases of imprisonment and fatal overdose. Despite the growing number of studies looking at this phenomenon, there remains a lack of neuroimaging data elucidating the neural markers of poly-drug use. In particular, the valuation system, tasked with weighing the value of items and experiences, may hold significance in understanding the motivations behind poly-drug use. To this end, we sought to analyze the functional connectivity of the Valuation System (VS), Executive Control System (ECS) and Valuation-Control Complex (VCC) of drug-using participants in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult dataset (n=992). Using multivariate regression, network-averaged connectivities were correlated with various substance use measures (stimulants, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates, sedatives and marijuana) and demographic variables (gender, parental use history). We found that the VS, ECS and VCC were all correlated with drug use behaviour either as individual systems or when paired with other substances. Both VS (R2= 0.53) and ECS (R2= 0.55) connectivity are positively correlated with stimulant use whereas both ECS (R2= 0.45) and VCC (R2= 0.045) connectivity are negatively correlated with marijuana use. VS (R2= 0.75) and VCC (R2= 0.74) connectivities are also negatively correlated with sedative use. Additionally, network connectivity was correlated with drug use behaviour via two-way interactions with other substances. These findings provide preliminary indications of the consequences of poly-drug use in healthy young adults. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in civilians and highly prevalent among military Servicemembers and in contact sports athletes. mTBI, especially within military populations, is often comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., sensation/novelty seeking, impulsivity, risk taking, irritability/aggression) and substance misuse/abuse, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an established mouse model of blast mTBI, here we examined the effects of single (1x) and repetitive (3x) blast exposure on ethanol responsivity using a battery of tests, each associated with distinct aspects of alcohol abuse vulnerability. While both single and repetitive blast exposure increased the sedative properties of high-dose ethanol (with no change in tolerance or metabolism), only repetitive blast exposure potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and shifted ethanol intake patterns (i.e., increased consumption front-loading) during intermittent two bottle choice. To establish translational relevance, we next examined self-report responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) and used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to investigate whether a history of blast with acute symptoms and mTBI affected drinking behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. AUDIT-C scores were increased in Veterans with a history of blast exposure and subsequent cluster analysis identified a three-cluster solution: low (low intake and low frequency), frequent (low intake but high frequency), and risky (high intake and high frequency), where Veterans with a history of blast mTBI displayed a shift in cluster assignment from frequent to risky, as compared to Veterans who were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan who had no lifetime history of TBI. Together, these results offer new insight regarding how blast mTBI may give rise to increased substance use/misuse and highlight the increased potential for adverse health-risk behaviors following repetitive blast mTBI exposure. ]]>

<![CDATA[ that has analyzed prior years of US distribution patterns, and further outlines regional and state specific methadone trends. MethodsThe Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) was used to acquire the number of narcotic treatment programs (NTPs) per state and methadone distribution weight in grams. Methadone distribution by weight, corrected for state populations, and number of NTPs were compared from 2017 to 2019 between states, within regions, and nationally. ResultsBetween 2017 and 2019, the national distribution of methadone increased 12.30% for NTPs but decreased 34.57% for pain, for a total increase of 2.66%. While all states saw a decrease in distribution for pain, when compared regionally, the Northeast showed a significantly smaller decrease than all other regions. Additionally, the majority of states experienced an increase in distribution for NTPs and most states demonstrated a relatively stable or increasing number of NTPs, with an 11.49% increase in NTPs nationally. The number of NTPs per 100K in 2019 ranged from 2.08 in Rhode Island to 0.00 in Wyoming. ConclusionAlthough methadone distribution for OUD was increasing in the US, there were pronounced regional disparities. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundAlthough effective treatments exist, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is undertreated. We used a cascade of care framework to understand gaps in care between diagnosis and treatment for persons with AUD. MethodsUsing 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we evaluated the following steps in the cascade of care: 1) prevalence of adults with AUD; 2) proportion of adults who utilized health care in the past 12 months; 3) were screened about alcohol use; 4) received a brief intervention about alcohol misuse; 5) received information about treatment for alcohol misuse; and 6) proportion of persons with AUD who received treatment. Analyses were stratified by AUD severity. ResultsOf the 171,766 persons included in the sample, weighted prevalence of AUD was 7.9% (95% CI 7.7-8.0%). Persons with AUD utilized health care settings at similar rates as those without AUD. Cascades of care showed the majority of individuals with AUD utilized health care and were screened about alcohol use, but the percent who received the subsequent steps of care decreased substantially. For those with severe AUD, 83.5% (CI: 78.3%-88.7%) utilized health care in the past 12 months, 73.5% (CI: 68.1%-78.9%) were screened for alcohol use, 22.7% (CI: 19.4%-26.0%) received a brief intervention, 12.4% (CI: 10%-14.7%) received information about treatment, and 20.5% (CI: 18%-23.1%) were treated for AUD. The greatest decrease in the care continuum occurred from screening to brief intervention and referral to treatment. More persons with severe AUD received treatment than were referred, indicating other pathways to treatment outside of the healthcare system. ConclusionsPersons with AUD utilize health care at high rates and are frequently screened about alcohol use, but few receive treatment. Health care settings-particularly primary care settings-represent a prime opportunity to implement pharmacologic treatment for AUD to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by compulsive searching for cocaine that produces cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis whose aims to more accurately model micro-structural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. As hypothesized, we found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. Correlations between significant ROIs showed a dependency of impulsivity and years of cocaine consumption over Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white-matter, however their clinical relevance remains questionable. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Impaired inhibitory control accompanied by enhanced salience attributed to drug-related cues, both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functions, are hallmarks of drug addiction, contributing to worse symptomatology including craving. dlPFC modulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed craving reduction in inpatients with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results. In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive function including impulsivity. An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group, an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group x time interactions showed improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and craving. This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundMore than 20 million Americans ages 12 and older have a past-year substance use disorder. Majority-minority cities, including Flint, MI, suffer disproportionately from higher rates of substance use and are less likely to have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions relative to predominately White and wealthier cities. Thus, identifying approaches that can improve implementation of evidence-based substance use practices is a critical public health goal. In the current report, we provide a detailed protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the Strengthening Flint Families initiative, a community-based implementation study of a multi-level behavioral health intervention that includes peer recovery coaching, the Strengthening Families Program, and a multimedia campaign. Our goal is to improve family resilience and reduce behavioral health disparities in the Flint community, as an example of how this could be done in other communities. Our overall strategy includes community-informed implementation enhancements to increase adoption and sustainment of evidence-based behavioral health services. MethodsThis project has 4 phases that align with study aims-1) a systematic assessment of behavioral health organizations in the Flint Area to understand organizational needs and strengths in Flint; 2) tailoring implementation strategies for one individual-level evidence-based practice, peer recovery coaching, and one family-level evidence-based program, the Strengthening Families Program; 3) building capacity and promoting sustainability; and 4) evaluating primary (implementation) and secondary (effectiveness) outcomes. Implementation outcomes are derived from the RE-AIM framework and effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at the individual, family, and community levels. DiscussionUnderstanding and addressing the behavioral health organizational needs, strengths, and barriers to program adoption and referral in Flint offers great promise to strengthen the behavioral health network of providers serving Flint residents. Moreover, understanding barriers to accessing and implementing behavioral health services in low-resource communities may prove to be a valuable tool for discovering the most effective implementation methods tailored to specific organizations. These evidence informed approaches may prove useful for cities outside of Flint. Contributions to the literatureMore research is needed on how best to improve community capacity for substance use services, especially in low-income communities This study will examine implementation strategies for improving community adoption and sustainment of a multilevel suite of substance use interventions Study findings will contribute to improved community-wide implementation of evidence-based behavioral health services and increased access to and participation in these services in low-resource communities ]]>

<![CDATA[ AimsTo investigate: (1) alcohol use during the pandemic in the UK; and (2) the extent to which poor inhibitory control and/or stress were associated with any change in alcohol use or hazardous drinking. DesignCross-sectional online survey administered between 2 and 31 May 2020. SettingUK. Participants13,453 respondents aged 19 - 62 years comprising participants of four nationally representative birth cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62-years old). MeasurementsChange in alcohol use and risk of alcohol-related harm due to hazardous drinking and change in stress since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak; inhibitory control (impatience and risk-taking); and sociodemographic characteristics, including diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and key worker status. FindingsMost respondents reported consuming/feeling the same amount or less alcohol/stress. However, a significant minority, particularly among thirty-(29.08%) and fifty-year-olds (26.67%), reported drinking more, and between 32.23% and 45.02% of respondents reported feeling more stressed depending on cohort. Being female was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting heightened stress (OR19 = 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.20; OR30 = 1.93, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.70; OR50 = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.92; OR62 = 2.03, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.48). Stress was associated with hazardous drinking among 30-year-olds (OR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.28). Impatience was associated with both increased alcohol use (1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) and hazardous drinking (1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) among 19-year-olds. Risk-taking was associated with hazardous drinking for 30-year-olds (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). ConclusionsThese data highlight concerns about the UK governments stance on the essential nature of off-premises alcohol sales during the lockdown, particularly from a public health perspective, when considering those at risk of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveThe current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodData were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. ResultsTwitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. ConclusionsExposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted. ]]>

<![CDATA[ IntroductionAddiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. ResultsThere were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI= 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI= 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI= 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI= 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI =1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI= 5%, 13%). DiscussionOur novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Poly-drug consumption is a dangerous, yet complex model of substance use that contributes to many cases of imprisonment and fatal overdose. Despite the growing number of studies looking at this phenomenon, there remains a lack of neuroimaging data elucidating the neural markers of poly-drug use. In particular, the valuation system, tasked with weighing the value of items and experiences, may hold significance in understanding the motivations behind poly-drug use. To this end, we sought to analyze the functional connectivity of the Valuation System (VS), Executive Control System (ECS) and Valuation-Control Complex (VCC) of drug-using participants in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult dataset (n=992). Using multivariate regression, network-averaged connectivities were correlated with various substance use measures (stimulants, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates, sedatives and marijuana) and demographic variables (gender, parental use history). We found that the VS, ECS and VCC were all correlated with drug use behaviour either as individual systems or when paired with other substances. Both VS (R2= 0.53) and ECS (R2= 0.55) connectivity are positively correlated with stimulant use whereas both ECS (R2= 0.45) and VCC (R2= 0.045) connectivity are negatively correlated with marijuana use. VS (R2= 0.75) and VCC (R2= 0.74) connectivities are also negatively correlated with sedative use. Additionally, network connectivity was correlated with drug use behaviour via two-way interactions with other substances. These findings provide preliminary indications of the consequences of poly-drug use in healthy young adults. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in civilians and highly prevalent among military Servicemembers and in contact sports athletes. mTBI, especially within military populations, is often comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., sensation/novelty seeking, impulsivity, risk taking, irritability/aggression) and substance misuse/abuse, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an established mouse model of blast mTBI, here we examined the effects of single (1x) and repetitive (3x) blast exposure on ethanol responsivity using a battery of tests, each associated with distinct aspects of alcohol abuse vulnerability. While both single and repetitive blast exposure increased the sedative properties of high-dose ethanol (with no change in tolerance or metabolism), only repetitive blast exposure potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and shifted ethanol intake patterns (i.e., increased consumption front-loading) during intermittent two bottle choice. To establish translational relevance, we next examined self-report responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) and used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to investigate whether a history of blast with acute symptoms and mTBI affected drinking behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. AUDIT-C scores were increased in Veterans with a history of blast exposure and subsequent cluster analysis identified a three-cluster solution: low (low intake and low frequency), frequent (low intake but high frequency), and risky (high intake and high frequency), where Veterans with a history of blast mTBI displayed a shift in cluster assignment from frequent to risky, as compared to Veterans who were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan who had no lifetime history of TBI. Together, these results offer new insight regarding how blast mTBI may give rise to increased substance use/misuse and highlight the increased potential for adverse health-risk behaviors following repetitive blast mTBI exposure. ]]>

<![CDATA[ that has analyzed prior years of US distribution patterns, and further outlines regional and state specific methadone trends. MethodsThe Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) was used to acquire the number of narcotic treatment programs (NTPs) per state and methadone distribution weight in grams. Methadone distribution by weight, corrected for state populations, and number of NTPs were compared from 2017 to 2019 between states, within regions, and nationally. ResultsBetween 2017 and 2019, the national distribution of methadone increased 12.30% for NTPs but decreased 34.57% for pain, for a total increase of 2.66%. While all states saw a decrease in distribution for pain, when compared regionally, the Northeast showed a significantly smaller decrease than all other regions. Additionally, the majority of states experienced an increase in distribution for NTPs and most states demonstrated a relatively stable or increasing number of NTPs, with an 11.49% increase in NTPs nationally. The number of NTPs per 100K in 2019 ranged from 2.08 in Rhode Island to 0.00 in Wyoming. ConclusionAlthough methadone distribution for OUD was increasing in the US, there were pronounced regional disparities. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ BackgroundAlthough effective treatments exist, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is undertreated. We used a cascade of care framework to understand gaps in care between diagnosis and treatment for persons with AUD. MethodsUsing 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we evaluated the following steps in the cascade of care: 1) prevalence of adults with AUD; 2) proportion of adults who utilized health care in the past 12 months; 3) were screened about alcohol use; 4) received a brief intervention about alcohol misuse; 5) received information about treatment for alcohol misuse; and 6) proportion of persons with AUD who received treatment. Analyses were stratified by AUD severity. ResultsOf the 171,766 persons included in the sample, weighted prevalence of AUD was 7.9% (95% CI 7.7-8.0%). Persons with AUD utilized health care settings at similar rates as those without AUD. Cascades of care showed the majority of individuals with AUD utilized health care and were screened about alcohol use, but the percent who received the subsequent steps of care decreased substantially. For those with severe AUD, 83.5% (CI: 78.3%-88.7%) utilized health care in the past 12 months, 73.5% (CI: 68.1%-78.9%) were screened for alcohol use, 22.7% (CI: 19.4%-26.0%) received a brief intervention, 12.4% (CI: 10%-14.7%) received information about treatment, and 20.5% (CI: 18%-23.1%) were treated for AUD. The greatest decrease in the care continuum occurred from screening to brief intervention and referral to treatment. More persons with severe AUD received treatment than were referred, indicating other pathways to treatment outside of the healthcare system. ConclusionsPersons with AUD utilize health care at high rates and are frequently screened about alcohol use, but few receive treatment. Health care settings-particularly primary care settings-represent a prime opportunity to implement pharmacologic treatment for AUD to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by compulsive searching for cocaine that produces cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis whose aims to more accurately model micro-structural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. As hypothesized, we found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. Correlations between significant ROIs showed a dependency of impulsivity and years of cocaine consumption over Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white-matter, however their clinical relevance remains questionable. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Impaired inhibitory control accompanied by enhanced salience attributed to drug-related cues, both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functions, are hallmarks of drug addiction, contributing to worse symptomatology including craving. dlPFC modulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed craving reduction in inpatients with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results. In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive function including impulsivity. An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group, an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group x time interactions showed improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and craving. This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundMore than 20 million Americans ages 12 and older have a past-year substance use disorder. Majority-minority cities, including Flint, MI, suffer disproportionately from higher rates of substance use and are less likely to have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions relative to predominately White and wealthier cities. Thus, identifying approaches that can improve implementation of evidence-based substance use practices is a critical public health goal. In the current report, we provide a detailed protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the Strengthening Flint Families initiative, a community-based implementation study of a multi-level behavioral health intervention that includes peer recovery coaching, the Strengthening Families Program, and a multimedia campaign. Our goal is to improve family resilience and reduce behavioral health disparities in the Flint community, as an example of how this could be done in other communities. Our overall strategy includes community-informed implementation enhancements to increase adoption and sustainment of evidence-based behavioral health services. MethodsThis project has 4 phases that align with study aims-1) a systematic assessment of behavioral health organizations in the Flint Area to understand organizational needs and strengths in Flint; 2) tailoring implementation strategies for one individual-level evidence-based practice, peer recovery coaching, and one family-level evidence-based program, the Strengthening Families Program; 3) building capacity and promoting sustainability; and 4) evaluating primary (implementation) and secondary (effectiveness) outcomes. Implementation outcomes are derived from the RE-AIM framework and effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at the individual, family, and community levels. DiscussionUnderstanding and addressing the behavioral health organizational needs, strengths, and barriers to program adoption and referral in Flint offers great promise to strengthen the behavioral health network of providers serving Flint residents. Moreover, understanding barriers to accessing and implementing behavioral health services in low-resource communities may prove to be a valuable tool for discovering the most effective implementation methods tailored to specific organizations. These evidence informed approaches may prove useful for cities outside of Flint. Contributions to the literatureMore research is needed on how best to improve community capacity for substance use services, especially in low-income communities This study will examine implementation strategies for improving community adoption and sustainment of a multilevel suite of substance use interventions Study findings will contribute to improved community-wide implementation of evidence-based behavioral health services and increased access to and participation in these services in low-resource communities ]]>

<![CDATA[ AimsTo investigate: (1) alcohol use during the pandemic in the UK; and (2) the extent to which poor inhibitory control and/or stress were associated with any change in alcohol use or hazardous drinking. DesignCross-sectional online survey administered between 2 and 31 May 2020. SettingUK. Participants13,453 respondents aged 19 - 62 years comprising participants of four nationally representative birth cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62-years old). MeasurementsChange in alcohol use and risk of alcohol-related harm due to hazardous drinking and change in stress since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak; inhibitory control (impatience and risk-taking); and sociodemographic characteristics, including diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and key worker status. FindingsMost respondents reported consuming/feeling the same amount or less alcohol/stress. However, a significant minority, particularly among thirty-(29.08%) and fifty-year-olds (26.67%), reported drinking more, and between 32.23% and 45.02% of respondents reported feeling more stressed depending on cohort. Being female was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting heightened stress (OR19 = 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.20; OR30 = 1.93, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.70; OR50 = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.92; OR62 = 2.03, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.48). Stress was associated with hazardous drinking among 30-year-olds (OR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.28). Impatience was associated with both increased alcohol use (1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) and hazardous drinking (1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) among 19-year-olds. Risk-taking was associated with hazardous drinking for 30-year-olds (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). ConclusionsThese data highlight concerns about the UK governments stance on the essential nature of off-premises alcohol sales during the lockdown, particularly from a public health perspective, when considering those at risk of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveThe current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodData were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. ResultsTwitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. ConclusionsExposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted. ]]>

<![CDATA[ IntroductionAddiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. ResultsThere were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI= 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI= 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI= 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI= 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI =1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI= 5%, 13%). DiscussionOur novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ Poly-drug consumption is a dangerous, yet complex model of substance use that contributes to many cases of imprisonment and fatal overdose. Despite the growing number of studies looking at this phenomenon, there remains a lack of neuroimaging data elucidating the neural markers of poly-drug use. In particular, the valuation system, tasked with weighing the value of items and experiences, may hold significance in understanding the motivations behind poly-drug use. To this end, we sought to analyze the functional connectivity of the Valuation System (VS), Executive Control System (ECS) and Valuation-Control Complex (VCC) of drug-using participants in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult dataset (n=992). Using multivariate regression, network-averaged connectivities were correlated with various substance use measures (stimulants, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates, sedatives and marijuana) and demographic variables (gender, parental use history). We found that the VS, ECS and VCC were all correlated with drug use behaviour either as individual systems or when paired with other substances. Both VS (R2= 0.53) and ECS (R2= 0.55) connectivity are positively correlated with stimulant use whereas both ECS (R2= 0.45) and VCC (R2= 0.045) connectivity are negatively correlated with marijuana use. VS (R2= 0.75) and VCC (R2= 0.74) connectivities are also negatively correlated with sedative use. Additionally, network connectivity was correlated with drug use behaviour via two-way interactions with other substances. These findings provide preliminary indications of the consequences of poly-drug use in healthy young adults. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in civilians and highly prevalent among military Servicemembers and in contact sports athletes. mTBI, especially within military populations, is often comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., sensation/novelty seeking, impulsivity, risk taking, irritability/aggression) and substance misuse/abuse, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an established mouse model of blast mTBI, here we examined the effects of single (1x) and repetitive (3x) blast exposure on ethanol responsivity using a battery of tests, each associated with distinct aspects of alcohol abuse vulnerability. While both single and repetitive blast exposure increased the sedative properties of high-dose ethanol (with no change in tolerance or metabolism), only repetitive blast exposure potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and shifted ethanol intake patterns (i.e., increased consumption front-loading) during intermittent two bottle choice. To establish translational relevance, we next examined self-report responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) and used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to investigate whether a history of blast with acute symptoms and mTBI affected drinking behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. AUDIT-C scores were increased in Veterans with a history of blast exposure and subsequent cluster analysis identified a three-cluster solution: low (low intake and low frequency), frequent (low intake but high frequency), and risky (high intake and high frequency), where Veterans with a history of blast mTBI displayed a shift in cluster assignment from frequent to risky, as compared to Veterans who were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan who had no lifetime history of TBI. Together, these results offer new insight regarding how blast mTBI may give rise to increased substance use/misuse and highlight the increased potential for adverse health-risk behaviors following repetitive blast mTBI exposure. ]]>

<![CDATA[ that has analyzed prior years of US distribution patterns, and further outlines regional and state specific methadone trends. MethodsThe Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) was used to acquire the number of narcotic treatment programs (NTPs) per state and methadone distribution weight in grams. Methadone distribution by weight, corrected for state populations, and number of NTPs were compared from 2017 to 2019 between states, within regions, and nationally. ResultsBetween 2017 and 2019, the national distribution of methadone increased 12.30% for NTPs but decreased 34.57% for pain, for a total increase of 2.66%. While all states saw a decrease in distribution for pain, when compared regionally, the Northeast showed a significantly smaller decrease than all other regions. Additionally, the majority of states experienced an increase in distribution for NTPs and most states demonstrated a relatively stable or increasing number of NTPs, with an 11.49% increase in NTPs nationally. The number of NTPs per 100K in 2019 ranged from 2.08 in Rhode Island to 0.00 in Wyoming. ConclusionAlthough methadone distribution for OUD was increasing in the US, there were pronounced regional disparities. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundAlthough effective treatments exist, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is undertreated. We used a cascade of care framework to understand gaps in care between diagnosis and treatment for persons with AUD. MethodsUsing 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we evaluated the following steps in the cascade of care: 1) prevalence of adults with AUD; 2) proportion of adults who utilized health care in the past 12 months; 3) were screened about alcohol use; 4) received a brief intervention about alcohol misuse; 5) received information about treatment for alcohol misuse; and 6) proportion of persons with AUD who received treatment. Analyses were stratified by AUD severity. ResultsOf the 171,766 persons included in the sample, weighted prevalence of AUD was 7.9% (95% CI 7.7-8.0%). Persons with AUD utilized health care settings at similar rates as those without AUD. Cascades of care showed the majority of individuals with AUD utilized health care and were screened about alcohol use, but the percent who received the subsequent steps of care decreased substantially. For those with severe AUD, 83.5% (CI: 78.3%-88.7%) utilized health care in the past 12 months, 73.5% (CI: 68.1%-78.9%) were screened for alcohol use, 22.7% (CI: 19.4%-26.0%) received a brief intervention, 12.4% (CI: 10%-14.7%) received information about treatment, and 20.5% (CI: 18%-23.1%) were treated for AUD. The greatest decrease in the care continuum occurred from screening to brief intervention and referral to treatment. More persons with severe AUD received treatment than were referred, indicating other pathways to treatment outside of the healthcare system. ConclusionsPersons with AUD utilize health care at high rates and are frequently screened about alcohol use, but few receive treatment. Health care settings-particularly primary care settings-represent a prime opportunity to implement pharmacologic treatment for AUD to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by compulsive searching for cocaine that produces cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis whose aims to more accurately model micro-structural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. As hypothesized, we found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. Correlations between significant ROIs showed a dependency of impulsivity and years of cocaine consumption over Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white-matter, however their clinical relevance remains questionable. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Impaired inhibitory control accompanied by enhanced salience attributed to drug-related cues, both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functions, are hallmarks of drug addiction, contributing to worse symptomatology including craving. dlPFC modulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed craving reduction in inpatients with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results. In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive function including impulsivity. An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group, an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group x time interactions showed improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and craving. This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundMore than 20 million Americans ages 12 and older have a past-year substance use disorder. Majority-minority cities, including Flint, MI, suffer disproportionately from higher rates of substance use and are less likely to have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions relative to predominately White and wealthier cities. Thus, identifying approaches that can improve implementation of evidence-based substance use practices is a critical public health goal. In the current report, we provide a detailed protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the Strengthening Flint Families initiative, a community-based implementation study of a multi-level behavioral health intervention that includes peer recovery coaching, the Strengthening Families Program, and a multimedia campaign. Our goal is to improve family resilience and reduce behavioral health disparities in the Flint community, as an example of how this could be done in other communities. Our overall strategy includes community-informed implementation enhancements to increase adoption and sustainment of evidence-based behavioral health services. MethodsThis project has 4 phases that align with study aims-1) a systematic assessment of behavioral health organizations in the Flint Area to understand organizational needs and strengths in Flint; 2) tailoring implementation strategies for one individual-level evidence-based practice, peer recovery coaching, and one family-level evidence-based program, the Strengthening Families Program; 3) building capacity and promoting sustainability; and 4) evaluating primary (implementation) and secondary (effectiveness) outcomes. Implementation outcomes are derived from the RE-AIM framework and effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at the individual, family, and community levels. DiscussionUnderstanding and addressing the behavioral health organizational needs, strengths, and barriers to program adoption and referral in Flint offers great promise to strengthen the behavioral health network of providers serving Flint residents. Moreover, understanding barriers to accessing and implementing behavioral health services in low-resource communities may prove to be a valuable tool for discovering the most effective implementation methods tailored to specific organizations. These evidence informed approaches may prove useful for cities outside of Flint. Contributions to the literatureMore research is needed on how best to improve community capacity for substance use services, especially in low-income communities This study will examine implementation strategies for improving community adoption and sustainment of a multilevel suite of substance use interventions Study findings will contribute to improved community-wide implementation of evidence-based behavioral health services and increased access to and participation in these services in low-resource communities ]]>

<![CDATA[ AimsTo investigate: (1) alcohol use during the pandemic in the UK; and (2) the extent to which poor inhibitory control and/or stress were associated with any change in alcohol use or hazardous drinking. DesignCross-sectional online survey administered between 2 and 31 May 2020. SettingUK. Participants13,453 respondents aged 19 - 62 years comprising participants of four nationally representative birth cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62-years old). MeasurementsChange in alcohol use and risk of alcohol-related harm due to hazardous drinking and change in stress since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak; inhibitory control (impatience and risk-taking); and sociodemographic characteristics, including diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and key worker status. FindingsMost respondents reported consuming/feeling the same amount or less alcohol/stress. However, a significant minority, particularly among thirty-(29.08%) and fifty-year-olds (26.67%), reported drinking more, and between 32.23% and 45.02% of respondents reported feeling more stressed depending on cohort. Being female was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting heightened stress (OR19 = 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.20; OR30 = 1.93, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.70; OR50 = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.92; OR62 = 2.03, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.48). Stress was associated with hazardous drinking among 30-year-olds (OR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.28). Impatience was associated with both increased alcohol use (1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) and hazardous drinking (1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) among 19-year-olds. Risk-taking was associated with hazardous drinking for 30-year-olds (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). ConclusionsThese data highlight concerns about the UK governments stance on the essential nature of off-premises alcohol sales during the lockdown, particularly from a public health perspective, when considering those at risk of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveThe current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodData were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. ResultsTwitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. ConclusionsExposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted. ]]>

<![CDATA[ IntroductionAddiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. ResultsThere were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI= 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI= 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI= 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI= 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI =1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI= 5%, 13%). DiscussionOur novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ Poly-drug consumption is a dangerous, yet complex model of substance use that contributes to many cases of imprisonment and fatal overdose. Despite the growing number of studies looking at this phenomenon, there remains a lack of neuroimaging data elucidating the neural markers of poly-drug use. In particular, the valuation system, tasked with weighing the value of items and experiences, may hold significance in understanding the motivations behind poly-drug use. To this end, we sought to analyze the functional connectivity of the Valuation System (VS), Executive Control System (ECS) and Valuation-Control Complex (VCC) of drug-using participants in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult dataset (n=992). Using multivariate regression, network-averaged connectivities were correlated with various substance use measures (stimulants, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates, sedatives and marijuana) and demographic variables (gender, parental use history). We found that the VS, ECS and VCC were all correlated with drug use behaviour either as individual systems or when paired with other substances. Both VS (R2= 0.53) and ECS (R2= 0.55) connectivity are positively correlated with stimulant use whereas both ECS (R2= 0.45) and VCC (R2= 0.045) connectivity are negatively correlated with marijuana use. VS (R2= 0.75) and VCC (R2= 0.74) connectivities are also negatively correlated with sedative use. Additionally, network connectivity was correlated with drug use behaviour via two-way interactions with other substances. These findings provide preliminary indications of the consequences of poly-drug use in healthy young adults. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in civilians and highly prevalent among military Servicemembers and in contact sports athletes. mTBI, especially within military populations, is often comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., sensation/novelty seeking, impulsivity, risk taking, irritability/aggression) and substance misuse/abuse, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an established mouse model of blast mTBI, here we examined the effects of single (1x) and repetitive (3x) blast exposure on ethanol responsivity using a battery of tests, each associated with distinct aspects of alcohol abuse vulnerability. While both single and repetitive blast exposure increased the sedative properties of high-dose ethanol (with no change in tolerance or metabolism), only repetitive blast exposure potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and shifted ethanol intake patterns (i.e., increased consumption front-loading) during intermittent two bottle choice. To establish translational relevance, we next examined self-report responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) and used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to investigate whether a history of blast with acute symptoms and mTBI affected drinking behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. AUDIT-C scores were increased in Veterans with a history of blast exposure and subsequent cluster analysis identified a three-cluster solution: low (low intake and low frequency), frequent (low intake but high frequency), and risky (high intake and high frequency), where Veterans with a history of blast mTBI displayed a shift in cluster assignment from frequent to risky, as compared to Veterans who were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan who had no lifetime history of TBI. Together, these results offer new insight regarding how blast mTBI may give rise to increased substance use/misuse and highlight the increased potential for adverse health-risk behaviors following repetitive blast mTBI exposure. ]]>

<![CDATA[ that has analyzed prior years of US distribution patterns, and further outlines regional and state specific methadone trends. MethodsThe Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) was used to acquire the number of narcotic treatment programs (NTPs) per state and methadone distribution weight in grams. Methadone distribution by weight, corrected for state populations, and number of NTPs were compared from 2017 to 2019 between states, within regions, and nationally. ResultsBetween 2017 and 2019, the national distribution of methadone increased 12.30% for NTPs but decreased 34.57% for pain, for a total increase of 2.66%. While all states saw a decrease in distribution for pain, when compared regionally, the Northeast showed a significantly smaller decrease than all other regions. Additionally, the majority of states experienced an increase in distribution for NTPs and most states demonstrated a relatively stable or increasing number of NTPs, with an 11.49% increase in NTPs nationally. The number of NTPs per 100K in 2019 ranged from 2.08 in Rhode Island to 0.00 in Wyoming. ConclusionAlthough methadone distribution for OUD was increasing in the US, there were pronounced regional disparities. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundAlthough effective treatments exist, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is undertreated. We used a cascade of care framework to understand gaps in care between diagnosis and treatment for persons with AUD. MethodsUsing 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we evaluated the following steps in the cascade of care: 1) prevalence of adults with AUD; 2) proportion of adults who utilized health care in the past 12 months; 3) were screened about alcohol use; 4) received a brief intervention about alcohol misuse; 5) received information about treatment for alcohol misuse; and 6) proportion of persons with AUD who received treatment. Analyses were stratified by AUD severity. ResultsOf the 171,766 persons included in the sample, weighted prevalence of AUD was 7.9% (95% CI 7.7-8.0%). Persons with AUD utilized health care settings at similar rates as those without AUD. Cascades of care showed the majority of individuals with AUD utilized health care and were screened about alcohol use, but the percent who received the subsequent steps of care decreased substantially. For those with severe AUD, 83.5% (CI: 78.3%-88.7%) utilized health care in the past 12 months, 73.5% (CI: 68.1%-78.9%) were screened for alcohol use, 22.7% (CI: 19.4%-26.0%) received a brief intervention, 12.4% (CI: 10%-14.7%) received information about treatment, and 20.5% (CI: 18%-23.1%) were treated for AUD. The greatest decrease in the care continuum occurred from screening to brief intervention and referral to treatment. More persons with severe AUD received treatment than were referred, indicating other pathways to treatment outside of the healthcare system. ConclusionsPersons with AUD utilize health care at high rates and are frequently screened about alcohol use, but few receive treatment. Health care settings-particularly primary care settings-represent a prime opportunity to implement pharmacologic treatment for AUD to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by compulsive searching for cocaine that produces cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis whose aims to more accurately model micro-structural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. As hypothesized, we found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. Correlations between significant ROIs showed a dependency of impulsivity and years of cocaine consumption over Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white-matter, however their clinical relevance remains questionable. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Impaired inhibitory control accompanied by enhanced salience attributed to drug-related cues, both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functions, are hallmarks of drug addiction, contributing to worse symptomatology including craving. dlPFC modulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed craving reduction in inpatients with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results. In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive function including impulsivity. An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group, an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group x time interactions showed improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and craving. This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundMore than 20 million Americans ages 12 and older have a past-year substance use disorder. Majority-minority cities, including Flint, MI, suffer disproportionately from higher rates of substance use and are less likely to have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions relative to predominately White and wealthier cities. Thus, identifying approaches that can improve implementation of evidence-based substance use practices is a critical public health goal. In the current report, we provide a detailed protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the Strengthening Flint Families initiative, a community-based implementation study of a multi-level behavioral health intervention that includes peer recovery coaching, the Strengthening Families Program, and a multimedia campaign. Our goal is to improve family resilience and reduce behavioral health disparities in the Flint community, as an example of how this could be done in other communities. Our overall strategy includes community-informed implementation enhancements to increase adoption and sustainment of evidence-based behavioral health services. MethodsThis project has 4 phases that align with study aims-1) a systematic assessment of behavioral health organizations in the Flint Area to understand organizational needs and strengths in Flint; 2) tailoring implementation strategies for one individual-level evidence-based practice, peer recovery coaching, and one family-level evidence-based program, the Strengthening Families Program; 3) building capacity and promoting sustainability; and 4) evaluating primary (implementation) and secondary (effectiveness) outcomes. Implementation outcomes are derived from the RE-AIM framework and effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at the individual, family, and community levels. DiscussionUnderstanding and addressing the behavioral health organizational needs, strengths, and barriers to program adoption and referral in Flint offers great promise to strengthen the behavioral health network of providers serving Flint residents. Moreover, understanding barriers to accessing and implementing behavioral health services in low-resource communities may prove to be a valuable tool for discovering the most effective implementation methods tailored to specific organizations. These evidence informed approaches may prove useful for cities outside of Flint. Contributions to the literatureMore research is needed on how best to improve community capacity for substance use services, especially in low-income communities This study will examine implementation strategies for improving community adoption and sustainment of a multilevel suite of substance use interventions Study findings will contribute to improved community-wide implementation of evidence-based behavioral health services and increased access to and participation in these services in low-resource communities ]]>

<![CDATA[ AimsTo investigate: (1) alcohol use during the pandemic in the UK; and (2) the extent to which poor inhibitory control and/or stress were associated with any change in alcohol use or hazardous drinking. DesignCross-sectional online survey administered between 2 and 31 May 2020. SettingUK. Participants13,453 respondents aged 19 - 62 years comprising participants of four nationally representative birth cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62-years old). MeasurementsChange in alcohol use and risk of alcohol-related harm due to hazardous drinking and change in stress since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak; inhibitory control (impatience and risk-taking); and sociodemographic characteristics, including diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and key worker status. FindingsMost respondents reported consuming/feeling the same amount or less alcohol/stress. However, a significant minority, particularly among thirty-(29.08%) and fifty-year-olds (26.67%), reported drinking more, and between 32.23% and 45.02% of respondents reported feeling more stressed depending on cohort. Being female was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting heightened stress (OR19 = 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.20; OR30 = 1.93, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.70; OR50 = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.92; OR62 = 2.03, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.48). Stress was associated with hazardous drinking among 30-year-olds (OR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.28). Impatience was associated with both increased alcohol use (1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) and hazardous drinking (1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) among 19-year-olds. Risk-taking was associated with hazardous drinking for 30-year-olds (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). ConclusionsThese data highlight concerns about the UK governments stance on the essential nature of off-premises alcohol sales during the lockdown, particularly from a public health perspective, when considering those at risk of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveThe current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodData were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. ResultsTwitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. ConclusionsExposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted. ]]>

<![CDATA[ IntroductionAddiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. ResultsThere were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI= 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI= 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI= 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI= 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI =1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI= 5%, 13%). DiscussionOur novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Poly-drug consumption is a dangerous, yet complex model of substance use that contributes to many cases of imprisonment and fatal overdose. Despite the growing number of studies looking at this phenomenon, there remains a lack of neuroimaging data elucidating the neural markers of poly-drug use. In particular, the valuation system, tasked with weighing the value of items and experiences, may hold significance in understanding the motivations behind poly-drug use. To this end, we sought to analyze the functional connectivity of the Valuation System (VS), Executive Control System (ECS) and Valuation-Control Complex (VCC) of drug-using participants in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult dataset (n=992). Using multivariate regression, network-averaged connectivities were correlated with various substance use measures (stimulants, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates, sedatives and marijuana) and demographic variables (gender, parental use history). We found that the VS, ECS and VCC were all correlated with drug use behaviour either as individual systems or when paired with other substances. Both VS (R2= 0.53) and ECS (R2= 0.55) connectivity are positively correlated with stimulant use whereas both ECS (R2= 0.45) and VCC (R2= 0.045) connectivity are negatively correlated with marijuana use. VS (R2= 0.75) and VCC (R2= 0.74) connectivities are also negatively correlated with sedative use. Additionally, network connectivity was correlated with drug use behaviour via two-way interactions with other substances. These findings provide preliminary indications of the consequences of poly-drug use in healthy young adults. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in civilians and highly prevalent among military Servicemembers and in contact sports athletes. mTBI, especially within military populations, is often comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., sensation/novelty seeking, impulsivity, risk taking, irritability/aggression) and substance misuse/abuse, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an established mouse model of blast mTBI, here we examined the effects of single (1x) and repetitive (3x) blast exposure on ethanol responsivity using a battery of tests, each associated with distinct aspects of alcohol abuse vulnerability. While both single and repetitive blast exposure increased the sedative properties of high-dose ethanol (with no change in tolerance or metabolism), only repetitive blast exposure potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and shifted ethanol intake patterns (i.e., increased consumption front-loading) during intermittent two bottle choice. To establish translational relevance, we next examined self-report responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) and used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to investigate whether a history of blast with acute symptoms and mTBI affected drinking behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. AUDIT-C scores were increased in Veterans with a history of blast exposure and subsequent cluster analysis identified a three-cluster solution: low (low intake and low frequency), frequent (low intake but high frequency), and risky (high intake and high frequency), where Veterans with a history of blast mTBI displayed a shift in cluster assignment from frequent to risky, as compared to Veterans who were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan who had no lifetime history of TBI. Together, these results offer new insight regarding how blast mTBI may give rise to increased substance use/misuse and highlight the increased potential for adverse health-risk behaviors following repetitive blast mTBI exposure. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveMethadone is an evidence based treatment for opioid use disorder and is also employed for acute pain. The primary objective of this study was to explore methadone distribution patterns between the years 2017 and 2019 across the United States (US). This study builds upon previous literature ]]>
<![CDATA[ that has analyzed prior years of US distribution patterns, and further outlines regional and state specific methadone trends. MethodsThe Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) was used to acquire the number of narcotic treatment programs (NTPs) per state and methadone distribution weight in grams. Methadone distribution by weight, corrected for state populations, and number of NTPs were compared from 2017 to 2019 between states, within regions, and nationally. ResultsBetween 2017 and 2019, the national distribution of methadone increased 12.30% for NTPs but decreased 34.57% for pain, for a total increase of 2.66%. While all states saw a decrease in distribution for pain, when compared regionally, the Northeast showed a significantly smaller decrease than all other regions. Additionally, the majority of states experienced an increase in distribution for NTPs and most states demonstrated a relatively stable or increasing number of NTPs, with an 11.49% increase in NTPs nationally. The number of NTPs per 100K in 2019 ranged from 2.08 in Rhode Island to 0.00 in Wyoming. ConclusionAlthough methadone distribution for OUD was increasing in the US, there were pronounced regional disparities. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundAlthough effective treatments exist, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is undertreated. We used a cascade of care framework to understand gaps in care between diagnosis and treatment for persons with AUD. MethodsUsing 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we evaluated the following steps in the cascade of care: 1) prevalence of adults with AUD; 2) proportion of adults who utilized health care in the past 12 months; 3) were screened about alcohol use; 4) received a brief intervention about alcohol misuse; 5) received information about treatment for alcohol misuse; and 6) proportion of persons with AUD who received treatment. Analyses were stratified by AUD severity. ResultsOf the 171,766 persons included in the sample, weighted prevalence of AUD was 7.9% (95% CI 7.7-8.0%). Persons with AUD utilized health care settings at similar rates as those without AUD. Cascades of care showed the majority of individuals with AUD utilized health care and were screened about alcohol use, but the percent who received the subsequent steps of care decreased substantially. For those with severe AUD, 83.5% (CI: 78.3%-88.7%) utilized health care in the past 12 months, 73.5% (CI: 68.1%-78.9%) were screened for alcohol use, 22.7% (CI: 19.4%-26.0%) received a brief intervention, 12.4% (CI: 10%-14.7%) received information about treatment, and 20.5% (CI: 18%-23.1%) were treated for AUD. The greatest decrease in the care continuum occurred from screening to brief intervention and referral to treatment. More persons with severe AUD received treatment than were referred, indicating other pathways to treatment outside of the healthcare system. ConclusionsPersons with AUD utilize health care at high rates and are frequently screened about alcohol use, but few receive treatment. Health care settings-particularly primary care settings-represent a prime opportunity to implement pharmacologic treatment for AUD to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by compulsive searching for cocaine that produces cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis whose aims to more accurately model micro-structural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. As hypothesized, we found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. Correlations between significant ROIs showed a dependency of impulsivity and years of cocaine consumption over Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white-matter, however their clinical relevance remains questionable. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Impaired inhibitory control accompanied by enhanced salience attributed to drug-related cues, both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functions, are hallmarks of drug addiction, contributing to worse symptomatology including craving. dlPFC modulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed craving reduction in inpatients with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results. In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive function including impulsivity. An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group, an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group x time interactions showed improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and craving. This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundMore than 20 million Americans ages 12 and older have a past-year substance use disorder. Majority-minority cities, including Flint, MI, suffer disproportionately from higher rates of substance use and are less likely to have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions relative to predominately White and wealthier cities. Thus, identifying approaches that can improve implementation of evidence-based substance use practices is a critical public health goal. In the current report, we provide a detailed protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the Strengthening Flint Families initiative, a community-based implementation study of a multi-level behavioral health intervention that includes peer recovery coaching, the Strengthening Families Program, and a multimedia campaign. Our goal is to improve family resilience and reduce behavioral health disparities in the Flint community, as an example of how this could be done in other communities. Our overall strategy includes community-informed implementation enhancements to increase adoption and sustainment of evidence-based behavioral health services. MethodsThis project has 4 phases that align with study aims-1) a systematic assessment of behavioral health organizations in the Flint Area to understand organizational needs and strengths in Flint; 2) tailoring implementation strategies for one individual-level evidence-based practice, peer recovery coaching, and one family-level evidence-based program, the Strengthening Families Program; 3) building capacity and promoting sustainability; and 4) evaluating primary (implementation) and secondary (effectiveness) outcomes. Implementation outcomes are derived from the RE-AIM framework and effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at the individual, family, and community levels. DiscussionUnderstanding and addressing the behavioral health organizational needs, strengths, and barriers to program adoption and referral in Flint offers great promise to strengthen the behavioral health network of providers serving Flint residents. Moreover, understanding barriers to accessing and implementing behavioral health services in low-resource communities may prove to be a valuable tool for discovering the most effective implementation methods tailored to specific organizations. These evidence informed approaches may prove useful for cities outside of Flint. Contributions to the literatureMore research is needed on how best to improve community capacity for substance use services, especially in low-income communities This study will examine implementation strategies for improving community adoption and sustainment of a multilevel suite of substance use interventions Study findings will contribute to improved community-wide implementation of evidence-based behavioral health services and increased access to and participation in these services in low-resource communities ]]>

<![CDATA[ AimsTo investigate: (1) alcohol use during the pandemic in the UK; and (2) the extent to which poor inhibitory control and/or stress were associated with any change in alcohol use or hazardous drinking. DesignCross-sectional online survey administered between 2 and 31 May 2020. SettingUK. Participants13,453 respondents aged 19 - 62 years comprising participants of four nationally representative birth cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62-years old). MeasurementsChange in alcohol use and risk of alcohol-related harm due to hazardous drinking and change in stress since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak; inhibitory control (impatience and risk-taking); and sociodemographic characteristics, including diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and key worker status. FindingsMost respondents reported consuming/feeling the same amount or less alcohol/stress. However, a significant minority, particularly among thirty-(29.08%) and fifty-year-olds (26.67%), reported drinking more, and between 32.23% and 45.02% of respondents reported feeling more stressed depending on cohort. Being female was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting heightened stress (OR19 = 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.20; OR30 = 1.93, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.70; OR50 = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.92; OR62 = 2.03, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.48). Stress was associated with hazardous drinking among 30-year-olds (OR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.28). Impatience was associated with both increased alcohol use (1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) and hazardous drinking (1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) among 19-year-olds. Risk-taking was associated with hazardous drinking for 30-year-olds (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). ConclusionsThese data highlight concerns about the UK governments stance on the essential nature of off-premises alcohol sales during the lockdown, particularly from a public health perspective, when considering those at risk of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveThe current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodData were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. ResultsTwitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. ConclusionsExposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted. ]]>

<![CDATA[ IntroductionAddiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. ResultsThere were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI= 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI= 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI= 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI= 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI =1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI= 5%, 13%). DiscussionOur novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Poly-drug consumption is a dangerous, yet complex model of substance use that contributes to many cases of imprisonment and fatal overdose. Despite the growing number of studies looking at this phenomenon, there remains a lack of neuroimaging data elucidating the neural markers of poly-drug use. In particular, the valuation system, tasked with weighing the value of items and experiences, may hold significance in understanding the motivations behind poly-drug use. To this end, we sought to analyze the functional connectivity of the Valuation System (VS), Executive Control System (ECS) and Valuation-Control Complex (VCC) of drug-using participants in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult dataset (n=992). Using multivariate regression, network-averaged connectivities were correlated with various substance use measures (stimulants, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates, sedatives and marijuana) and demographic variables (gender, parental use history). We found that the VS, ECS and VCC were all correlated with drug use behaviour either as individual systems or when paired with other substances. Both VS (R2= 0.53) and ECS (R2= 0.55) connectivity are positively correlated with stimulant use whereas both ECS (R2= 0.45) and VCC (R2= 0.045) connectivity are negatively correlated with marijuana use. VS (R2= 0.75) and VCC (R2= 0.74) connectivities are also negatively correlated with sedative use. Additionally, network connectivity was correlated with drug use behaviour via two-way interactions with other substances. These findings provide preliminary indications of the consequences of poly-drug use in healthy young adults. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in civilians and highly prevalent among military Servicemembers and in contact sports athletes. mTBI, especially within military populations, is often comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., sensation/novelty seeking, impulsivity, risk taking, irritability/aggression) and substance misuse/abuse, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an established mouse model of blast mTBI, here we examined the effects of single (1x) and repetitive (3x) blast exposure on ethanol responsivity using a battery of tests, each associated with distinct aspects of alcohol abuse vulnerability. While both single and repetitive blast exposure increased the sedative properties of high-dose ethanol (with no change in tolerance or metabolism), only repetitive blast exposure potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and shifted ethanol intake patterns (i.e., increased consumption front-loading) during intermittent two bottle choice. To establish translational relevance, we next examined self-report responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) and used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to investigate whether a history of blast with acute symptoms and mTBI affected drinking behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. AUDIT-C scores were increased in Veterans with a history of blast exposure and subsequent cluster analysis identified a three-cluster solution: low (low intake and low frequency), frequent (low intake but high frequency), and risky (high intake and high frequency), where Veterans with a history of blast mTBI displayed a shift in cluster assignment from frequent to risky, as compared to Veterans who were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan who had no lifetime history of TBI. Together, these results offer new insight regarding how blast mTBI may give rise to increased substance use/misuse and highlight the increased potential for adverse health-risk behaviors following repetitive blast mTBI exposure. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveMethadone is an evidence based treatment for opioid use disorder and is also employed for acute pain. The primary objective of this study was to explore methadone distribution patterns between the years 2017 and 2019 across the United States (US). This study builds upon previous literature ]]>
<![CDATA[ that has analyzed prior years of US distribution patterns, and further outlines regional and state specific methadone trends. MethodsThe Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) was used to acquire the number of narcotic treatment programs (NTPs) per state and methadone distribution weight in grams. Methadone distribution by weight, corrected for state populations, and number of NTPs were compared from 2017 to 2019 between states, within regions, and nationally. ResultsBetween 2017 and 2019, the national distribution of methadone increased 12.30% for NTPs but decreased 34.57% for pain, for a total increase of 2.66%. While all states saw a decrease in distribution for pain, when compared regionally, the Northeast showed a significantly smaller decrease than all other regions. Additionally, the majority of states experienced an increase in distribution for NTPs and most states demonstrated a relatively stable or increasing number of NTPs, with an 11.49% increase in NTPs nationally. The number of NTPs per 100K in 2019 ranged from 2.08 in Rhode Island to 0.00 in Wyoming. ConclusionAlthough methadone distribution for OUD was increasing in the US, there were pronounced regional disparities. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundAlthough effective treatments exist, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is undertreated. We used a cascade of care framework to understand gaps in care between diagnosis and treatment for persons with AUD. MethodsUsing 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we evaluated the following steps in the cascade of care: 1) prevalence of adults with AUD; 2) proportion of adults who utilized health care in the past 12 months; 3) were screened about alcohol use; 4) received a brief intervention about alcohol misuse; 5) received information about treatment for alcohol misuse; and 6) proportion of persons with AUD who received treatment. Analyses were stratified by AUD severity. ResultsOf the 171,766 persons included in the sample, weighted prevalence of AUD was 7.9% (95% CI 7.7-8.0%). Persons with AUD utilized health care settings at similar rates as those without AUD. Cascades of care showed the majority of individuals with AUD utilized health care and were screened about alcohol use, but the percent who received the subsequent steps of care decreased substantially. For those with severe AUD, 83.5% (CI: 78.3%-88.7%) utilized health care in the past 12 months, 73.5% (CI: 68.1%-78.9%) were screened for alcohol use, 22.7% (CI: 19.4%-26.0%) received a brief intervention, 12.4% (CI: 10%-14.7%) received information about treatment, and 20.5% (CI: 18%-23.1%) were treated for AUD. The greatest decrease in the care continuum occurred from screening to brief intervention and referral to treatment. More persons with severe AUD received treatment than were referred, indicating other pathways to treatment outside of the healthcare system. ConclusionsPersons with AUD utilize health care at high rates and are frequently screened about alcohol use, but few receive treatment. Health care settings-particularly primary care settings-represent a prime opportunity to implement pharmacologic treatment for AUD to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by compulsive searching for cocaine that produces cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis whose aims to more accurately model micro-structural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. As hypothesized, we found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. Correlations between significant ROIs showed a dependency of impulsivity and years of cocaine consumption over Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white-matter, however their clinical relevance remains questionable. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Impaired inhibitory control accompanied by enhanced salience attributed to drug-related cues, both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functions, are hallmarks of drug addiction, contributing to worse symptomatology including craving. dlPFC modulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed craving reduction in inpatients with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results. In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive function including impulsivity. An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group, an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group x time interactions showed improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and craving. This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundMore than 20 million Americans ages 12 and older have a past-year substance use disorder. Majority-minority cities, including Flint, MI, suffer disproportionately from higher rates of substance use and are less likely to have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions relative to predominately White and wealthier cities. Thus, identifying approaches that can improve implementation of evidence-based substance use practices is a critical public health goal. In the current report, we provide a detailed protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the Strengthening Flint Families initiative, a community-based implementation study of a multi-level behavioral health intervention that includes peer recovery coaching, the Strengthening Families Program, and a multimedia campaign. Our goal is to improve family resilience and reduce behavioral health disparities in the Flint community, as an example of how this could be done in other communities. Our overall strategy includes community-informed implementation enhancements to increase adoption and sustainment of evidence-based behavioral health services. MethodsThis project has 4 phases that align with study aims-1) a systematic assessment of behavioral health organizations in the Flint Area to understand organizational needs and strengths in Flint; 2) tailoring implementation strategies for one individual-level evidence-based practice, peer recovery coaching, and one family-level evidence-based program, the Strengthening Families Program; 3) building capacity and promoting sustainability; and 4) evaluating primary (implementation) and secondary (effectiveness) outcomes. Implementation outcomes are derived from the RE-AIM framework and effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at the individual, family, and community levels. DiscussionUnderstanding and addressing the behavioral health organizational needs, strengths, and barriers to program adoption and referral in Flint offers great promise to strengthen the behavioral health network of providers serving Flint residents. Moreover, understanding barriers to accessing and implementing behavioral health services in low-resource communities may prove to be a valuable tool for discovering the most effective implementation methods tailored to specific organizations. These evidence informed approaches may prove useful for cities outside of Flint. Contributions to the literatureMore research is needed on how best to improve community capacity for substance use services, especially in low-income communities This study will examine implementation strategies for improving community adoption and sustainment of a multilevel suite of substance use interventions Study findings will contribute to improved community-wide implementation of evidence-based behavioral health services and increased access to and participation in these services in low-resource communities ]]>

<![CDATA[ AimsTo investigate: (1) alcohol use during the pandemic in the UK; and (2) the extent to which poor inhibitory control and/or stress were associated with any change in alcohol use or hazardous drinking. DesignCross-sectional online survey administered between 2 and 31 May 2020. SettingUK. Participants13,453 respondents aged 19 - 62 years comprising participants of four nationally representative birth cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62-years old). MeasurementsChange in alcohol use and risk of alcohol-related harm due to hazardous drinking and change in stress since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak; inhibitory control (impatience and risk-taking); and sociodemographic characteristics, including diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and key worker status. FindingsMost respondents reported consuming/feeling the same amount or less alcohol/stress. However, a significant minority, particularly among thirty-(29.08%) and fifty-year-olds (26.67%), reported drinking more, and between 32.23% and 45.02% of respondents reported feeling more stressed depending on cohort. Being female was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting heightened stress (OR19 = 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.20; OR30 = 1.93, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.70; OR50 = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.92; OR62 = 2.03, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.48). Stress was associated with hazardous drinking among 30-year-olds (OR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.28). Impatience was associated with both increased alcohol use (1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) and hazardous drinking (1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) among 19-year-olds. Risk-taking was associated with hazardous drinking for 30-year-olds (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). ConclusionsThese data highlight concerns about the UK governments stance on the essential nature of off-premises alcohol sales during the lockdown, particularly from a public health perspective, when considering those at risk of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveThe current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodData were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. ResultsTwitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. ConclusionsExposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted. ]]>

<![CDATA[ IntroductionAddiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. ResultsThere were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI= 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI= 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI= 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI= 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI =1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI= 5%, 13%). DiscussionOur novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ Poly-drug consumption is a dangerous, yet complex model of substance use that contributes to many cases of imprisonment and fatal overdose. Despite the growing number of studies looking at this phenomenon, there remains a lack of neuroimaging data elucidating the neural markers of poly-drug use. In particular, the valuation system, tasked with weighing the value of items and experiences, may hold significance in understanding the motivations behind poly-drug use. To this end, we sought to analyze the functional connectivity of the Valuation System (VS), Executive Control System (ECS) and Valuation-Control Complex (VCC) of drug-using participants in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult dataset (n=992). Using multivariate regression, network-averaged connectivities were correlated with various substance use measures (stimulants, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates, sedatives and marijuana) and demographic variables (gender, parental use history). We found that the VS, ECS and VCC were all correlated with drug use behaviour either as individual systems or when paired with other substances. Both VS (R2= 0.53) and ECS (R2= 0.55) connectivity are positively correlated with stimulant use whereas both ECS (R2= 0.45) and VCC (R2= 0.045) connectivity are negatively correlated with marijuana use. VS (R2= 0.75) and VCC (R2= 0.74) connectivities are also negatively correlated with sedative use. Additionally, network connectivity was correlated with drug use behaviour via two-way interactions with other substances. These findings provide preliminary indications of the consequences of poly-drug use in healthy young adults. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in civilians and highly prevalent among military Servicemembers and in contact sports athletes. mTBI, especially within military populations, is often comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., sensation/novelty seeking, impulsivity, risk taking, irritability/aggression) and substance misuse/abuse, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an established mouse model of blast mTBI, here we examined the effects of single (1x) and repetitive (3x) blast exposure on ethanol responsivity using a battery of tests, each associated with distinct aspects of alcohol abuse vulnerability. While both single and repetitive blast exposure increased the sedative properties of high-dose ethanol (with no change in tolerance or metabolism), only repetitive blast exposure potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and shifted ethanol intake patterns (i.e., increased consumption front-loading) during intermittent two bottle choice. To establish translational relevance, we next examined self-report responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) and used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to investigate whether a history of blast with acute symptoms and mTBI affected drinking behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. AUDIT-C scores were increased in Veterans with a history of blast exposure and subsequent cluster analysis identified a three-cluster solution: low (low intake and low frequency), frequent (low intake but high frequency), and risky (high intake and high frequency), where Veterans with a history of blast mTBI displayed a shift in cluster assignment from frequent to risky, as compared to Veterans who were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan who had no lifetime history of TBI. Together, these results offer new insight regarding how blast mTBI may give rise to increased substance use/misuse and highlight the increased potential for adverse health-risk behaviors following repetitive blast mTBI exposure. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveMethadone is an evidence based treatment for opioid use disorder and is also employed for acute pain. The primary objective of this study was to explore methadone distribution patterns between the years 2017 and 2019 across the United States (US). This study builds upon previous literature ]]>
<![CDATA[ that has analyzed prior years of US distribution patterns, and further outlines regional and state specific methadone trends. MethodsThe Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) was used to acquire the number of narcotic treatment programs (NTPs) per state and methadone distribution weight in grams. Methadone distribution by weight, corrected for state populations, and number of NTPs were compared from 2017 to 2019 between states, within regions, and nationally. ResultsBetween 2017 and 2019, the national distribution of methadone increased 12.30% for NTPs but decreased 34.57% for pain, for a total increase of 2.66%. While all states saw a decrease in distribution for pain, when compared regionally, the Northeast showed a significantly smaller decrease than all other regions. Additionally, the majority of states experienced an increase in distribution for NTPs and most states demonstrated a relatively stable or increasing number of NTPs, with an 11.49% increase in NTPs nationally. The number of NTPs per 100K in 2019 ranged from 2.08 in Rhode Island to 0.00 in Wyoming. ConclusionAlthough methadone distribution for OUD was increasing in the US, there were pronounced regional disparities. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundAlthough effective treatments exist, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is undertreated. We used a cascade of care framework to understand gaps in care between diagnosis and treatment for persons with AUD. MethodsUsing 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we evaluated the following steps in the cascade of care: 1) prevalence of adults with AUD; 2) proportion of adults who utilized health care in the past 12 months; 3) were screened about alcohol use; 4) received a brief intervention about alcohol misuse; 5) received information about treatment for alcohol misuse; and 6) proportion of persons with AUD who received treatment. Analyses were stratified by AUD severity. ResultsOf the 171,766 persons included in the sample, weighted prevalence of AUD was 7.9% (95% CI 7.7-8.0%). Persons with AUD utilized health care settings at similar rates as those without AUD. Cascades of care showed the majority of individuals with AUD utilized health care and were screened about alcohol use, but the percent who received the subsequent steps of care decreased substantially. For those with severe AUD, 83.5% (CI: 78.3%-88.7%) utilized health care in the past 12 months, 73.5% (CI: 68.1%-78.9%) were screened for alcohol use, 22.7% (CI: 19.4%-26.0%) received a brief intervention, 12.4% (CI: 10%-14.7%) received information about treatment, and 20.5% (CI: 18%-23.1%) were treated for AUD. The greatest decrease in the care continuum occurred from screening to brief intervention and referral to treatment. More persons with severe AUD received treatment than were referred, indicating other pathways to treatment outside of the healthcare system. ConclusionsPersons with AUD utilize health care at high rates and are frequently screened about alcohol use, but few receive treatment. Health care settings-particularly primary care settings-represent a prime opportunity to implement pharmacologic treatment for AUD to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by compulsive searching for cocaine that produces cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis whose aims to more accurately model micro-structural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. As hypothesized, we found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. Correlations between significant ROIs showed a dependency of impulsivity and years of cocaine consumption over Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white-matter, however their clinical relevance remains questionable. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Impaired inhibitory control accompanied by enhanced salience attributed to drug-related cues, both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functions, are hallmarks of drug addiction, contributing to worse symptomatology including craving. dlPFC modulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed craving reduction in inpatients with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results. In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive function including impulsivity. An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group, an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group x time interactions showed improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and craving. This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundMore than 20 million Americans ages 12 and older have a past-year substance use disorder. Majority-minority cities, including Flint, MI, suffer disproportionately from higher rates of substance use and are less likely to have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions relative to predominately White and wealthier cities. Thus, identifying approaches that can improve implementation of evidence-based substance use practices is a critical public health goal. In the current report, we provide a detailed protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the Strengthening Flint Families initiative, a community-based implementation study of a multi-level behavioral health intervention that includes peer recovery coaching, the Strengthening Families Program, and a multimedia campaign. Our goal is to improve family resilience and reduce behavioral health disparities in the Flint community, as an example of how this could be done in other communities. Our overall strategy includes community-informed implementation enhancements to increase adoption and sustainment of evidence-based behavioral health services. MethodsThis project has 4 phases that align with study aims-1) a systematic assessment of behavioral health organizations in the Flint Area to understand organizational needs and strengths in Flint; 2) tailoring implementation strategies for one individual-level evidence-based practice, peer recovery coaching, and one family-level evidence-based program, the Strengthening Families Program; 3) building capacity and promoting sustainability; and 4) evaluating primary (implementation) and secondary (effectiveness) outcomes. Implementation outcomes are derived from the RE-AIM framework and effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at the individual, family, and community levels. DiscussionUnderstanding and addressing the behavioral health organizational needs, strengths, and barriers to program adoption and referral in Flint offers great promise to strengthen the behavioral health network of providers serving Flint residents. Moreover, understanding barriers to accessing and implementing behavioral health services in low-resource communities may prove to be a valuable tool for discovering the most effective implementation methods tailored to specific organizations. These evidence informed approaches may prove useful for cities outside of Flint. Contributions to the literatureMore research is needed on how best to improve community capacity for substance use services, especially in low-income communities This study will examine implementation strategies for improving community adoption and sustainment of a multilevel suite of substance use interventions Study findings will contribute to improved community-wide implementation of evidence-based behavioral health services and increased access to and participation in these services in low-resource communities ]]>

<![CDATA[ AimsTo investigate: (1) alcohol use during the pandemic in the UK; and (2) the extent to which poor inhibitory control and/or stress were associated with any change in alcohol use or hazardous drinking. DesignCross-sectional online survey administered between 2 and 31 May 2020. SettingUK. Participants13,453 respondents aged 19 - 62 years comprising participants of four nationally representative birth cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62-years old). MeasurementsChange in alcohol use and risk of alcohol-related harm due to hazardous drinking and change in stress since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak; inhibitory control (impatience and risk-taking); and sociodemographic characteristics, including diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and key worker status. FindingsMost respondents reported consuming/feeling the same amount or less alcohol/stress. However, a significant minority, particularly among thirty-(29.08%) and fifty-year-olds (26.67%), reported drinking more, and between 32.23% and 45.02% of respondents reported feeling more stressed depending on cohort. Being female was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting heightened stress (OR19 = 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.20; OR30 = 1.93, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.70; OR50 = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.92; OR62 = 2.03, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.48). Stress was associated with hazardous drinking among 30-year-olds (OR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.28). Impatience was associated with both increased alcohol use (1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) and hazardous drinking (1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) among 19-year-olds. Risk-taking was associated with hazardous drinking for 30-year-olds (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). ConclusionsThese data highlight concerns about the UK governments stance on the essential nature of off-premises alcohol sales during the lockdown, particularly from a public health perspective, when considering those at risk of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveThe current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodData were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. ResultsTwitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. ConclusionsExposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted. ]]>

<![CDATA[ IntroductionAddiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. ResultsThere were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI= 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI= 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI= 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI= 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI =1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI= 5%, 13%). DiscussionOur novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ Poly-drug consumption is a dangerous, yet complex model of substance use that contributes to many cases of imprisonment and fatal overdose. Despite the growing number of studies looking at this phenomenon, there remains a lack of neuroimaging data elucidating the neural markers of poly-drug use. In particular, the valuation system, tasked with weighing the value of items and experiences, may hold significance in understanding the motivations behind poly-drug use. To this end, we sought to analyze the functional connectivity of the Valuation System (VS), Executive Control System (ECS) and Valuation-Control Complex (VCC) of drug-using participants in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult dataset (n=992). Using multivariate regression, network-averaged connectivities were correlated with various substance use measures (stimulants, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates, sedatives and marijuana) and demographic variables (gender, parental use history). We found that the VS, ECS and VCC were all correlated with drug use behaviour either as individual systems or when paired with other substances. Both VS (R2= 0.53) and ECS (R2= 0.55) connectivity are positively correlated with stimulant use whereas both ECS (R2= 0.45) and VCC (R2= 0.045) connectivity are negatively correlated with marijuana use. VS (R2= 0.75) and VCC (R2= 0.74) connectivities are also negatively correlated with sedative use. Additionally, network connectivity was correlated with drug use behaviour via two-way interactions with other substances. These findings provide preliminary indications of the consequences of poly-drug use in healthy young adults. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in civilians and highly prevalent among military Servicemembers and in contact sports athletes. mTBI, especially within military populations, is often comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., sensation/novelty seeking, impulsivity, risk taking, irritability/aggression) and substance misuse/abuse, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an established mouse model of blast mTBI, here we examined the effects of single (1x) and repetitive (3x) blast exposure on ethanol responsivity using a battery of tests, each associated with distinct aspects of alcohol abuse vulnerability. While both single and repetitive blast exposure increased the sedative properties of high-dose ethanol (with no change in tolerance or metabolism), only repetitive blast exposure potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and shifted ethanol intake patterns (i.e., increased consumption front-loading) during intermittent two bottle choice. To establish translational relevance, we next examined self-report responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) and used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to investigate whether a history of blast with acute symptoms and mTBI affected drinking behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. AUDIT-C scores were increased in Veterans with a history of blast exposure and subsequent cluster analysis identified a three-cluster solution: low (low intake and low frequency), frequent (low intake but high frequency), and risky (high intake and high frequency), where Veterans with a history of blast mTBI displayed a shift in cluster assignment from frequent to risky, as compared to Veterans who were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan who had no lifetime history of TBI. Together, these results offer new insight regarding how blast mTBI may give rise to increased substance use/misuse and highlight the increased potential for adverse health-risk behaviors following repetitive blast mTBI exposure. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveMethadone is an evidence based treatment for opioid use disorder and is also employed for acute pain. The primary objective of this study was to explore methadone distribution patterns between the years 2017 and 2019 across the United States (US). This study builds upon previous literature ]]>
<![CDATA[ that has analyzed prior years of US distribution patterns, and further outlines regional and state specific methadone trends. MethodsThe Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) was used to acquire the number of narcotic treatment programs (NTPs) per state and methadone distribution weight in grams. Methadone distribution by weight, corrected for state populations, and number of NTPs were compared from 2017 to 2019 between states, within regions, and nationally. ResultsBetween 2017 and 2019, the national distribution of methadone increased 12.30% for NTPs but decreased 34.57% for pain, for a total increase of 2.66%. While all states saw a decrease in distribution for pain, when compared regionally, the Northeast showed a significantly smaller decrease than all other regions. Additionally, the majority of states experienced an increase in distribution for NTPs and most states demonstrated a relatively stable or increasing number of NTPs, with an 11.49% increase in NTPs nationally. The number of NTPs per 100K in 2019 ranged from 2.08 in Rhode Island to 0.00 in Wyoming. ConclusionAlthough methadone distribution for OUD was increasing in the US, there were pronounced regional disparities. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundAlthough effective treatments exist, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is undertreated. We used a cascade of care framework to understand gaps in care between diagnosis and treatment for persons with AUD. MethodsUsing 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we evaluated the following steps in the cascade of care: 1) prevalence of adults with AUD; 2) proportion of adults who utilized health care in the past 12 months; 3) were screened about alcohol use; 4) received a brief intervention about alcohol misuse; 5) received information about treatment for alcohol misuse; and 6) proportion of persons with AUD who received treatment. Analyses were stratified by AUD severity. ResultsOf the 171,766 persons included in the sample, weighted prevalence of AUD was 7.9% (95% CI 7.7-8.0%). Persons with AUD utilized health care settings at similar rates as those without AUD. Cascades of care showed the majority of individuals with AUD utilized health care and were screened about alcohol use, but the percent who received the subsequent steps of care decreased substantially. For those with severe AUD, 83.5% (CI: 78.3%-88.7%) utilized health care in the past 12 months, 73.5% (CI: 68.1%-78.9%) were screened for alcohol use, 22.7% (CI: 19.4%-26.0%) received a brief intervention, 12.4% (CI: 10%-14.7%) received information about treatment, and 20.5% (CI: 18%-23.1%) were treated for AUD. The greatest decrease in the care continuum occurred from screening to brief intervention and referral to treatment. More persons with severe AUD received treatment than were referred, indicating other pathways to treatment outside of the healthcare system. ConclusionsPersons with AUD utilize health care at high rates and are frequently screened about alcohol use, but few receive treatment. Health care settings-particularly primary care settings-represent a prime opportunity to implement pharmacologic treatment for AUD to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by compulsive searching for cocaine that produces cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis whose aims to more accurately model micro-structural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. As hypothesized, we found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. Correlations between significant ROIs showed a dependency of impulsivity and years of cocaine consumption over Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white-matter, however their clinical relevance remains questionable. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Impaired inhibitory control accompanied by enhanced salience attributed to drug-related cues, both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functions, are hallmarks of drug addiction, contributing to worse symptomatology including craving. dlPFC modulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed craving reduction in inpatients with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results. In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive function including impulsivity. An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group, an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group x time interactions showed improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and craving. This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundMore than 20 million Americans ages 12 and older have a past-year substance use disorder. Majority-minority cities, including Flint, MI, suffer disproportionately from higher rates of substance use and are less likely to have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions relative to predominately White and wealthier cities. Thus, identifying approaches that can improve implementation of evidence-based substance use practices is a critical public health goal. In the current report, we provide a detailed protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the Strengthening Flint Families initiative, a community-based implementation study of a multi-level behavioral health intervention that includes peer recovery coaching, the Strengthening Families Program, and a multimedia campaign. Our goal is to improve family resilience and reduce behavioral health disparities in the Flint community, as an example of how this could be done in other communities. Our overall strategy includes community-informed implementation enhancements to increase adoption and sustainment of evidence-based behavioral health services. MethodsThis project has 4 phases that align with study aims-1) a systematic assessment of behavioral health organizations in the Flint Area to understand organizational needs and strengths in Flint; 2) tailoring implementation strategies for one individual-level evidence-based practice, peer recovery coaching, and one family-level evidence-based program, the Strengthening Families Program; 3) building capacity and promoting sustainability; and 4) evaluating primary (implementation) and secondary (effectiveness) outcomes. Implementation outcomes are derived from the RE-AIM framework and effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at the individual, family, and community levels. DiscussionUnderstanding and addressing the behavioral health organizational needs, strengths, and barriers to program adoption and referral in Flint offers great promise to strengthen the behavioral health network of providers serving Flint residents. Moreover, understanding barriers to accessing and implementing behavioral health services in low-resource communities may prove to be a valuable tool for discovering the most effective implementation methods tailored to specific organizations. These evidence informed approaches may prove useful for cities outside of Flint. Contributions to the literatureMore research is needed on how best to improve community capacity for substance use services, especially in low-income communities This study will examine implementation strategies for improving community adoption and sustainment of a multilevel suite of substance use interventions Study findings will contribute to improved community-wide implementation of evidence-based behavioral health services and increased access to and participation in these services in low-resource communities ]]>

<![CDATA[ AimsTo investigate: (1) alcohol use during the pandemic in the UK; and (2) the extent to which poor inhibitory control and/or stress were associated with any change in alcohol use or hazardous drinking. DesignCross-sectional online survey administered between 2 and 31 May 2020. SettingUK. Participants13,453 respondents aged 19 - 62 years comprising participants of four nationally representative birth cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62-years old). MeasurementsChange in alcohol use and risk of alcohol-related harm due to hazardous drinking and change in stress since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak; inhibitory control (impatience and risk-taking); and sociodemographic characteristics, including diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and key worker status. FindingsMost respondents reported consuming/feeling the same amount or less alcohol/stress. However, a significant minority, particularly among thirty-(29.08%) and fifty-year-olds (26.67%), reported drinking more, and between 32.23% and 45.02% of respondents reported feeling more stressed depending on cohort. Being female was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting heightened stress (OR19 = 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.20; OR30 = 1.93, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.70; OR50 = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.92; OR62 = 2.03, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.48). Stress was associated with hazardous drinking among 30-year-olds (OR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.28). Impatience was associated with both increased alcohol use (1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) and hazardous drinking (1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) among 19-year-olds. Risk-taking was associated with hazardous drinking for 30-year-olds (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). ConclusionsThese data highlight concerns about the UK governments stance on the essential nature of off-premises alcohol sales during the lockdown, particularly from a public health perspective, when considering those at risk of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveThe current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodData were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. ResultsTwitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. ConclusionsExposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted. ]]>

<![CDATA[ IntroductionAddiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. ResultsThere were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI= 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI= 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI= 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI= 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI =1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI= 5%, 13%). DiscussionOur novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Poly-drug consumption is a dangerous, yet complex model of substance use that contributes to many cases of imprisonment and fatal overdose. Despite the growing number of studies looking at this phenomenon, there remains a lack of neuroimaging data elucidating the neural markers of poly-drug use. In particular, the valuation system, tasked with weighing the value of items and experiences, may hold significance in understanding the motivations behind poly-drug use. To this end, we sought to analyze the functional connectivity of the Valuation System (VS), Executive Control System (ECS) and Valuation-Control Complex (VCC) of drug-using participants in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult dataset (n=992). Using multivariate regression, network-averaged connectivities were correlated with various substance use measures (stimulants, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates, sedatives and marijuana) and demographic variables (gender, parental use history). We found that the VS, ECS and VCC were all correlated with drug use behaviour either as individual systems or when paired with other substances. Both VS (R2= 0.53) and ECS (R2= 0.55) connectivity are positively correlated with stimulant use whereas both ECS (R2= 0.45) and VCC (R2= 0.045) connectivity are negatively correlated with marijuana use. VS (R2= 0.75) and VCC (R2= 0.74) connectivities are also negatively correlated with sedative use. Additionally, network connectivity was correlated with drug use behaviour via two-way interactions with other substances. These findings provide preliminary indications of the consequences of poly-drug use in healthy young adults. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in civilians and highly prevalent among military Servicemembers and in contact sports athletes. mTBI, especially within military populations, is often comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., sensation/novelty seeking, impulsivity, risk taking, irritability/aggression) and substance misuse/abuse, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an established mouse model of blast mTBI, here we examined the effects of single (1x) and repetitive (3x) blast exposure on ethanol responsivity using a battery of tests, each associated with distinct aspects of alcohol abuse vulnerability. While both single and repetitive blast exposure increased the sedative properties of high-dose ethanol (with no change in tolerance or metabolism), only repetitive blast exposure potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and shifted ethanol intake patterns (i.e., increased consumption front-loading) during intermittent two bottle choice. To establish translational relevance, we next examined self-report responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) and used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to investigate whether a history of blast with acute symptoms and mTBI affected drinking behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. AUDIT-C scores were increased in Veterans with a history of blast exposure and subsequent cluster analysis identified a three-cluster solution: low (low intake and low frequency), frequent (low intake but high frequency), and risky (high intake and high frequency), where Veterans with a history of blast mTBI displayed a shift in cluster assignment from frequent to risky, as compared to Veterans who were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan who had no lifetime history of TBI. Together, these results offer new insight regarding how blast mTBI may give rise to increased substance use/misuse and highlight the increased potential for adverse health-risk behaviors following repetitive blast mTBI exposure. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveMethadone is an evidence based treatment for opioid use disorder and is also employed for acute pain. The primary objective of this study was to explore methadone distribution patterns between the years 2017 and 2019 across the United States (US). This study builds upon previous literature ]]>
<![CDATA[ that has analyzed prior years of US distribution patterns, and further outlines regional and state specific methadone trends. MethodsThe Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) was used to acquire the number of narcotic treatment programs (NTPs) per state and methadone distribution weight in grams. Methadone distribution by weight, corrected for state populations, and number of NTPs were compared from 2017 to 2019 between states, within regions, and nationally. ResultsBetween 2017 and 2019, the national distribution of methadone increased 12.30% for NTPs but decreased 34.57% for pain, for a total increase of 2.66%. While all states saw a decrease in distribution for pain, when compared regionally, the Northeast showed a significantly smaller decrease than all other regions. Additionally, the majority of states experienced an increase in distribution for NTPs and most states demonstrated a relatively stable or increasing number of NTPs, with an 11.49% increase in NTPs nationally. The number of NTPs per 100K in 2019 ranged from 2.08 in Rhode Island to 0.00 in Wyoming. ConclusionAlthough methadone distribution for OUD was increasing in the US, there were pronounced regional disparities. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ BackgroundAlthough effective treatments exist, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is undertreated. We used a cascade of care framework to understand gaps in care between diagnosis and treatment for persons with AUD. MethodsUsing 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we evaluated the following steps in the cascade of care: 1) prevalence of adults with AUD; 2) proportion of adults who utilized health care in the past 12 months; 3) were screened about alcohol use; 4) received a brief intervention about alcohol misuse; 5) received information about treatment for alcohol misuse; and 6) proportion of persons with AUD who received treatment. Analyses were stratified by AUD severity. ResultsOf the 171,766 persons included in the sample, weighted prevalence of AUD was 7.9% (95% CI 7.7-8.0%). Persons with AUD utilized health care settings at similar rates as those without AUD. Cascades of care showed the majority of individuals with AUD utilized health care and were screened about alcohol use, but the percent who received the subsequent steps of care decreased substantially. For those with severe AUD, 83.5% (CI: 78.3%-88.7%) utilized health care in the past 12 months, 73.5% (CI: 68.1%-78.9%) were screened for alcohol use, 22.7% (CI: 19.4%-26.0%) received a brief intervention, 12.4% (CI: 10%-14.7%) received information about treatment, and 20.5% (CI: 18%-23.1%) were treated for AUD. The greatest decrease in the care continuum occurred from screening to brief intervention and referral to treatment. More persons with severe AUD received treatment than were referred, indicating other pathways to treatment outside of the healthcare system. ConclusionsPersons with AUD utilize health care at high rates and are frequently screened about alcohol use, but few receive treatment. Health care settings-particularly primary care settings-represent a prime opportunity to implement pharmacologic treatment for AUD to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by compulsive searching for cocaine that produces cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis whose aims to more accurately model micro-structural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. As hypothesized, we found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. Correlations between significant ROIs showed a dependency of impulsivity and years of cocaine consumption over Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white-matter, however their clinical relevance remains questionable. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Impaired inhibitory control accompanied by enhanced salience attributed to drug-related cues, both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functions, are hallmarks of drug addiction, contributing to worse symptomatology including craving. dlPFC modulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed craving reduction in inpatients with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results. In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive function including impulsivity. An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group, an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group x time interactions showed improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and craving. This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions. ]]>

<![CDATA[ BackgroundMore than 20 million Americans ages 12 and older have a past-year substance use disorder. Majority-minority cities, including Flint, MI, suffer disproportionately from higher rates of substance use and are less likely to have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions relative to predominately White and wealthier cities. Thus, identifying approaches that can improve implementation of evidence-based substance use practices is a critical public health goal. In the current report, we provide a detailed protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the Strengthening Flint Families initiative, a community-based implementation study of a multi-level behavioral health intervention that includes peer recovery coaching, the Strengthening Families Program, and a multimedia campaign. Our goal is to improve family resilience and reduce behavioral health disparities in the Flint community, as an example of how this could be done in other communities. Our overall strategy includes community-informed implementation enhancements to increase adoption and sustainment of evidence-based behavioral health services. MethodsThis project has 4 phases that align with study aims-1) a systematic assessment of behavioral health organizations in the Flint Area to understand organizational needs and strengths in Flint; 2) tailoring implementation strategies for one individual-level evidence-based practice, peer recovery coaching, and one family-level evidence-based program, the Strengthening Families Program; 3) building capacity and promoting sustainability; and 4) evaluating primary (implementation) and secondary (effectiveness) outcomes. Implementation outcomes are derived from the RE-AIM framework and effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at the individual, family, and community levels. DiscussionUnderstanding and addressing the behavioral health organizational needs, strengths, and barriers to program adoption and referral in Flint offers great promise to strengthen the behavioral health network of providers serving Flint residents. Moreover, understanding barriers to accessing and implementing behavioral health services in low-resource communities may prove to be a valuable tool for discovering the most effective implementation methods tailored to specific organizations. These evidence informed approaches may prove useful for cities outside of Flint. Contributions to the literatureMore research is needed on how best to improve community capacity for substance use services, especially in low-income communities This study will examine implementation strategies for improving community adoption and sustainment of a multilevel suite of substance use interventions Study findings will contribute to improved community-wide implementation of evidence-based behavioral health services and increased access to and participation in these services in low-resource communities ]]>

<![CDATA[ AimsTo investigate: (1) alcohol use during the pandemic in the UK; and (2) the extent to which poor inhibitory control and/or stress were associated with any change in alcohol use or hazardous drinking. DesignCross-sectional online survey administered between 2 and 31 May 2020. SettingUK. Participants13,453 respondents aged 19 - 62 years comprising participants of four nationally representative birth cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62-years old). MeasurementsChange in alcohol use and risk of alcohol-related harm due to hazardous drinking and change in stress since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak; inhibitory control (impatience and risk-taking); and sociodemographic characteristics, including diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and key worker status. FindingsMost respondents reported consuming/feeling the same amount or less alcohol/stress. However, a significant minority, particularly among thirty-(29.08%) and fifty-year-olds (26.67%), reported drinking more, and between 32.23% and 45.02% of respondents reported feeling more stressed depending on cohort. Being female was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting heightened stress (OR19 = 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.20; OR30 = 1.93, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.70; OR50 = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.92; OR62 = 2.03, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.48). Stress was associated with hazardous drinking among 30-year-olds (OR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.28). Impatience was associated with both increased alcohol use (1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) and hazardous drinking (1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) among 19-year-olds. Risk-taking was associated with hazardous drinking for 30-year-olds (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). ConclusionsThese data highlight concerns about the UK governments stance on the essential nature of off-premises alcohol sales during the lockdown, particularly from a public health perspective, when considering those at risk of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveThe current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodData were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. ResultsTwitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. ConclusionsExposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted. ]]>

<![CDATA[ IntroductionAddiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. ResultsThere were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI= 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI= 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI= 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI= 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI =1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI= 5%, 13%). DiscussionOur novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Poly-drug consumption is a dangerous, yet complex model of substance use that contributes to many cases of imprisonment and fatal overdose. Despite the growing number of studies looking at this phenomenon, there remains a lack of neuroimaging data elucidating the neural markers of poly-drug use. In particular, the valuation system, tasked with weighing the value of items and experiences, may hold significance in understanding the motivations behind poly-drug use. To this end, we sought to analyze the functional connectivity of the Valuation System (VS), Executive Control System (ECS) and Valuation-Control Complex (VCC) of drug-using participants in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult dataset (n=992). Using multivariate regression, network-averaged connectivities were correlated with various substance use measures (stimulants, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates, sedatives and marijuana) and demographic variables (gender, parental use history). We found that the VS, ECS and VCC were all correlated with drug use behaviour either as individual systems or when paired with other substances. Both VS (R2= 0.53) and ECS (R2= 0.55) connectivity are positively correlated with stimulant use whereas both ECS (R2= 0.45) and VCC (R2= 0.045) connectivity are negatively correlated with marijuana use. VS (R2= 0.75) and VCC (R2= 0.74) connectivities are also negatively correlated with sedative use. Additionally, network connectivity was correlated with drug use behaviour via two-way interactions with other substances. These findings provide preliminary indications of the consequences of poly-drug use in healthy young adults. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in civilians and highly prevalent among military Servicemembers and in contact sports athletes. mTBI, especially within military populations, is often comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., sensation/novelty seeking, impulsivity, risk taking, irritability/aggression) and substance misuse/abuse, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an established mouse model of blast mTBI, here we examined the effects of single (1x) and repetitive (3x) blast exposure on ethanol responsivity using a battery of tests, each associated with distinct aspects of alcohol abuse vulnerability. While both single and repetitive blast exposure increased the sedative properties of high-dose ethanol (with no change in tolerance or metabolism), only repetitive blast exposure potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and shifted ethanol intake patterns (i.e., increased consumption front-loading) during intermittent two bottle choice. To establish translational relevance, we next examined self-report responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) and used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to investigate whether a history of blast with acute symptoms and mTBI affected drinking behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. AUDIT-C scores were increased in Veterans with a history of blast exposure and subsequent cluster analysis identified a three-cluster solution: low (low intake and low frequency), frequent (low intake but high frequency), and risky (high intake and high frequency), where Veterans with a history of blast mTBI displayed a shift in cluster assignment from frequent to risky, as compared to Veterans who were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan who had no lifetime history of TBI. Together, these results offer new insight regarding how blast mTBI may give rise to increased substance use/misuse and highlight the increased potential for adverse health-risk behaviors following repetitive blast mTBI exposure. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveMethadone is an evidence based treatment for opioid use disorder and is also employed for acute pain. The primary objective of this study was to explore methadone distribution patterns between the years 2017 and 2019 across the United States (US). This study builds upon previous literature ]]>
<![CDATA[ that has analyzed prior years of US distribution patterns, and further outlines regional and state specific methadone trends. MethodsThe Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) was used to acquire the number of narcotic treatment programs (NTPs) per state and methadone distribution weight in grams. Methadone distribution by weight, corrected for state populations, and number of NTPs were compared from 2017 to 2019 between states, within regions, and nationally. ResultsBetween 2017 and 2019, the national distribution of methadone increased 12.30% for NTPs but decreased 34.57% for pain, for a total increase of 2.66%. While all states saw a decrease in distribution for pain, when compared regionally, the Northeast showed a significantly smaller decrease than all other regions. Additionally, the majority of states experienced an increase in distribution for NTPs and most states demonstrated a relatively stable or increasing number of NTPs, with an 11.49% increase in NTPs nationally. The number of NTPs per 100K in 2019 ranged from 2.08 in Rhode Island to 0.00 in Wyoming. ConclusionAlthough methadone distribution for OUD was increasing in the US, there were pronounced regional disparities. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ BackgroundAlthough effective treatments exist, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is undertreated. We used a cascade of care framework to understand gaps in care between diagnosis and treatment for persons with AUD. MethodsUsing 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we evaluated the following steps in the cascade of care: 1) prevalence of adults with AUD; 2) proportion of adults who utilized health care in the past 12 months; 3) were screened about alcohol use; 4) received a brief intervention about alcohol misuse; 5) received information about treatment for alcohol misuse; and 6) proportion of persons with AUD who received treatment. Analyses were stratified by AUD severity. ResultsOf the 171,766 persons included in the sample, weighted prevalence of AUD was 7.9% (95% CI 7.7-8.0%). Persons with AUD utilized health care settings at similar rates as those without AUD. Cascades of care showed the majority of individuals with AUD utilized health care and were screened about alcohol use, but the percent who received the subsequent steps of care decreased substantially. For those with severe AUD, 83.5% (CI: 78.3%-88.7%) utilized health care in the past 12 months, 73.5% (CI: 68.1%-78.9%) were screened for alcohol use, 22.7% (CI: 19.4%-26.0%) received a brief intervention, 12.4% (CI: 10%-14.7%) received information about treatment, and 20.5% (CI: 18%-23.1%) were treated for AUD. The greatest decrease in the care continuum occurred from screening to brief intervention and referral to treatment. More persons with severe AUD received treatment than were referred, indicating other pathways to treatment outside of the healthcare system. ConclusionsPersons with AUD utilize health care at high rates and are frequently screened about alcohol use, but few receive treatment. Health care settings-particularly primary care settings-represent a prime opportunity to implement pharmacologic treatment for AUD to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by compulsive searching for cocaine that produces cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis whose aims to more accurately model micro-structural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. As hypothesized, we found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. Correlations between significant ROIs showed a dependency of impulsivity and years of cocaine consumption over Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white-matter, however their clinical relevance remains questionable. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Impaired inhibitory control accompanied by enhanced salience attributed to drug-related cues, both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functions, are hallmarks of drug addiction, contributing to worse symptomatology including craving. dlPFC modulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed craving reduction in inpatients with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results. In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive function including impulsivity. An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group, an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group x time interactions showed improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and craving. This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ BackgroundMore than 20 million Americans ages 12 and older have a past-year substance use disorder. Majority-minority cities, including Flint, MI, suffer disproportionately from higher rates of substance use and are less likely to have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions relative to predominately White and wealthier cities. Thus, identifying approaches that can improve implementation of evidence-based substance use practices is a critical public health goal. In the current report, we provide a detailed protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the Strengthening Flint Families initiative, a community-based implementation study of a multi-level behavioral health intervention that includes peer recovery coaching, the Strengthening Families Program, and a multimedia campaign. Our goal is to improve family resilience and reduce behavioral health disparities in the Flint community, as an example of how this could be done in other communities. Our overall strategy includes community-informed implementation enhancements to increase adoption and sustainment of evidence-based behavioral health services. MethodsThis project has 4 phases that align with study aims-1) a systematic assessment of behavioral health organizations in the Flint Area to understand organizational needs and strengths in Flint; 2) tailoring implementation strategies for one individual-level evidence-based practice, peer recovery coaching, and one family-level evidence-based program, the Strengthening Families Program; 3) building capacity and promoting sustainability; and 4) evaluating primary (implementation) and secondary (effectiveness) outcomes. Implementation outcomes are derived from the RE-AIM framework and effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at the individual, family, and community levels. DiscussionUnderstanding and addressing the behavioral health organizational needs, strengths, and barriers to program adoption and referral in Flint offers great promise to strengthen the behavioral health network of providers serving Flint residents. Moreover, understanding barriers to accessing and implementing behavioral health services in low-resource communities may prove to be a valuable tool for discovering the most effective implementation methods tailored to specific organizations. These evidence informed approaches may prove useful for cities outside of Flint. Contributions to the literatureMore research is needed on how best to improve community capacity for substance use services, especially in low-income communities This study will examine implementation strategies for improving community adoption and sustainment of a multilevel suite of substance use interventions Study findings will contribute to improved community-wide implementation of evidence-based behavioral health services and increased access to and participation in these services in low-resource communities ]]>

<![CDATA[ AimsTo investigate: (1) alcohol use during the pandemic in the UK; and (2) the extent to which poor inhibitory control and/or stress were associated with any change in alcohol use or hazardous drinking. DesignCross-sectional online survey administered between 2 and 31 May 2020. SettingUK. Participants13,453 respondents aged 19 - 62 years comprising participants of four nationally representative birth cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62-years old). MeasurementsChange in alcohol use and risk of alcohol-related harm due to hazardous drinking and change in stress since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak; inhibitory control (impatience and risk-taking); and sociodemographic characteristics, including diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and key worker status. FindingsMost respondents reported consuming/feeling the same amount or less alcohol/stress. However, a significant minority, particularly among thirty-(29.08%) and fifty-year-olds (26.67%), reported drinking more, and between 32.23% and 45.02% of respondents reported feeling more stressed depending on cohort. Being female was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting heightened stress (OR19 = 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.20; OR30 = 1.93, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.70; OR50 = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.92; OR62 = 2.03, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.48). Stress was associated with hazardous drinking among 30-year-olds (OR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.28). Impatience was associated with both increased alcohol use (1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) and hazardous drinking (1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) among 19-year-olds. Risk-taking was associated with hazardous drinking for 30-year-olds (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). ConclusionsThese data highlight concerns about the UK governments stance on the essential nature of off-premises alcohol sales during the lockdown, particularly from a public health perspective, when considering those at risk of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveThe current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodData were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. ResultsTwitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. ConclusionsExposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted. ]]>

<![CDATA[ IntroductionAddiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. ResultsThere were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI= 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI= 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI= 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI= 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI =1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI= 5%, 13%). DiscussionOur novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Poly-drug consumption is a dangerous, yet complex model of substance use that contributes to many cases of imprisonment and fatal overdose. Despite the growing number of studies looking at this phenomenon, there remains a lack of neuroimaging data elucidating the neural markers of poly-drug use. In particular, the valuation system, tasked with weighing the value of items and experiences, may hold significance in understanding the motivations behind poly-drug use. To this end, we sought to analyze the functional connectivity of the Valuation System (VS), Executive Control System (ECS) and Valuation-Control Complex (VCC) of drug-using participants in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult dataset (n=992). Using multivariate regression, network-averaged connectivities were correlated with various substance use measures (stimulants, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates, sedatives and marijuana) and demographic variables (gender, parental use history). We found that the VS, ECS and VCC were all correlated with drug use behaviour either as individual systems or when paired with other substances. Both VS (R2= 0.53) and ECS (R2= 0.55) connectivity are positively correlated with stimulant use whereas both ECS (R2= 0.45) and VCC (R2= 0.045) connectivity are negatively correlated with marijuana use. VS (R2= 0.75) and VCC (R2= 0.74) connectivities are also negatively correlated with sedative use. Additionally, network connectivity was correlated with drug use behaviour via two-way interactions with other substances. These findings provide preliminary indications of the consequences of poly-drug use in healthy young adults. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in civilians and highly prevalent among military Servicemembers and in contact sports athletes. mTBI, especially within military populations, is often comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., sensation/novelty seeking, impulsivity, risk taking, irritability/aggression) and substance misuse/abuse, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an established mouse model of blast mTBI, here we examined the effects of single (1x) and repetitive (3x) blast exposure on ethanol responsivity using a battery of tests, each associated with distinct aspects of alcohol abuse vulnerability. While both single and repetitive blast exposure increased the sedative properties of high-dose ethanol (with no change in tolerance or metabolism), only repetitive blast exposure potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and shifted ethanol intake patterns (i.e., increased consumption front-loading) during intermittent two bottle choice. To establish translational relevance, we next examined self-report responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) and used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to investigate whether a history of blast with acute symptoms and mTBI affected drinking behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. AUDIT-C scores were increased in Veterans with a history of blast exposure and subsequent cluster analysis identified a three-cluster solution: low (low intake and low frequency), frequent (low intake but high frequency), and risky (high intake and high frequency), where Veterans with a history of blast mTBI displayed a shift in cluster assignment from frequent to risky, as compared to Veterans who were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan who had no lifetime history of TBI. Together, these results offer new insight regarding how blast mTBI may give rise to increased substance use/misuse and highlight the increased potential for adverse health-risk behaviors following repetitive blast mTBI exposure. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveMethadone is an evidence based treatment for opioid use disorder and is also employed for acute pain. The primary objective of this study was to explore methadone distribution patterns between the years 2017 and 2019 across the United States (US). This study builds upon previous literature ]]>
<![CDATA[ that has analyzed prior years of US distribution patterns, and further outlines regional and state specific methadone trends. MethodsThe Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) was used to acquire the number of narcotic treatment programs (NTPs) per state and methadone distribution weight in grams. Methadone distribution by weight, corrected for state populations, and number of NTPs were compared from 2017 to 2019 between states, within regions, and nationally. ResultsBetween 2017 and 2019, the national distribution of methadone increased 12.30% for NTPs but decreased 34.57% for pain, for a total increase of 2.66%. While all states saw a decrease in distribution for pain, when compared regionally, the Northeast showed a significantly smaller decrease than all other regions. Additionally, the majority of states experienced an increase in distribution for NTPs and most states demonstrated a relatively stable or increasing number of NTPs, with an 11.49% increase in NTPs nationally. The number of NTPs per 100K in 2019 ranged from 2.08 in Rhode Island to 0.00 in Wyoming. ConclusionAlthough methadone distribution for OUD was increasing in the US, there were pronounced regional disparities. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ BackgroundAlthough effective treatments exist, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is undertreated. We used a cascade of care framework to understand gaps in care between diagnosis and treatment for persons with AUD. MethodsUsing 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we evaluated the following steps in the cascade of care: 1) prevalence of adults with AUD; 2) proportion of adults who utilized health care in the past 12 months; 3) were screened about alcohol use; 4) received a brief intervention about alcohol misuse; 5) received information about treatment for alcohol misuse; and 6) proportion of persons with AUD who received treatment. Analyses were stratified by AUD severity. ResultsOf the 171,766 persons included in the sample, weighted prevalence of AUD was 7.9% (95% CI 7.7-8.0%). Persons with AUD utilized health care settings at similar rates as those without AUD. Cascades of care showed the majority of individuals with AUD utilized health care and were screened about alcohol use, but the percent who received the subsequent steps of care decreased substantially. For those with severe AUD, 83.5% (CI: 78.3%-88.7%) utilized health care in the past 12 months, 73.5% (CI: 68.1%-78.9%) were screened for alcohol use, 22.7% (CI: 19.4%-26.0%) received a brief intervention, 12.4% (CI: 10%-14.7%) received information about treatment, and 20.5% (CI: 18%-23.1%) were treated for AUD. The greatest decrease in the care continuum occurred from screening to brief intervention and referral to treatment. More persons with severe AUD received treatment than were referred, indicating other pathways to treatment outside of the healthcare system. ConclusionsPersons with AUD utilize health care at high rates and are frequently screened about alcohol use, but few receive treatment. Health care settings-particularly primary care settings-represent a prime opportunity to implement pharmacologic treatment for AUD to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by compulsive searching for cocaine that produces cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis whose aims to more accurately model micro-structural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. As hypothesized, we found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. Correlations between significant ROIs showed a dependency of impulsivity and years of cocaine consumption over Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white-matter, however their clinical relevance remains questionable. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Impaired inhibitory control accompanied by enhanced salience attributed to drug-related cues, both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functions, are hallmarks of drug addiction, contributing to worse symptomatology including craving. dlPFC modulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed craving reduction in inpatients with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results. In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive function including impulsivity. An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group, an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group x time interactions showed improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and craving. This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ BackgroundMore than 20 million Americans ages 12 and older have a past-year substance use disorder. Majority-minority cities, including Flint, MI, suffer disproportionately from higher rates of substance use and are less likely to have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions relative to predominately White and wealthier cities. Thus, identifying approaches that can improve implementation of evidence-based substance use practices is a critical public health goal. In the current report, we provide a detailed protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the Strengthening Flint Families initiative, a community-based implementation study of a multi-level behavioral health intervention that includes peer recovery coaching, the Strengthening Families Program, and a multimedia campaign. Our goal is to improve family resilience and reduce behavioral health disparities in the Flint community, as an example of how this could be done in other communities. Our overall strategy includes community-informed implementation enhancements to increase adoption and sustainment of evidence-based behavioral health services. MethodsThis project has 4 phases that align with study aims-1) a systematic assessment of behavioral health organizations in the Flint Area to understand organizational needs and strengths in Flint; 2) tailoring implementation strategies for one individual-level evidence-based practice, peer recovery coaching, and one family-level evidence-based program, the Strengthening Families Program; 3) building capacity and promoting sustainability; and 4) evaluating primary (implementation) and secondary (effectiveness) outcomes. Implementation outcomes are derived from the RE-AIM framework and effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at the individual, family, and community levels. DiscussionUnderstanding and addressing the behavioral health organizational needs, strengths, and barriers to program adoption and referral in Flint offers great promise to strengthen the behavioral health network of providers serving Flint residents. Moreover, understanding barriers to accessing and implementing behavioral health services in low-resource communities may prove to be a valuable tool for discovering the most effective implementation methods tailored to specific organizations. These evidence informed approaches may prove useful for cities outside of Flint. Contributions to the literatureMore research is needed on how best to improve community capacity for substance use services, especially in low-income communities This study will examine implementation strategies for improving community adoption and sustainment of a multilevel suite of substance use interventions Study findings will contribute to improved community-wide implementation of evidence-based behavioral health services and increased access to and participation in these services in low-resource communities ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ AimsTo investigate: (1) alcohol use during the pandemic in the UK; and (2) the extent to which poor inhibitory control and/or stress were associated with any change in alcohol use or hazardous drinking. DesignCross-sectional online survey administered between 2 and 31 May 2020. SettingUK. Participants13,453 respondents aged 19 - 62 years comprising participants of four nationally representative birth cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62-years old). MeasurementsChange in alcohol use and risk of alcohol-related harm due to hazardous drinking and change in stress since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak; inhibitory control (impatience and risk-taking); and sociodemographic characteristics, including diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and key worker status. FindingsMost respondents reported consuming/feeling the same amount or less alcohol/stress. However, a significant minority, particularly among thirty-(29.08%) and fifty-year-olds (26.67%), reported drinking more, and between 32.23% and 45.02% of respondents reported feeling more stressed depending on cohort. Being female was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting heightened stress (OR19 = 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.20; OR30 = 1.93, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.70; OR50 = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.92; OR62 = 2.03, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.48). Stress was associated with hazardous drinking among 30-year-olds (OR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.28). Impatience was associated with both increased alcohol use (1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) and hazardous drinking (1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) among 19-year-olds. Risk-taking was associated with hazardous drinking for 30-year-olds (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). ConclusionsThese data highlight concerns about the UK governments stance on the essential nature of off-premises alcohol sales during the lockdown, particularly from a public health perspective, when considering those at risk of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveThe current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodData were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. ResultsTwitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. ConclusionsExposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted. ]]>

<![CDATA[ IntroductionAddiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. ResultsThere were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI= 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI= 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI= 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI= 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI =1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI= 5%, 13%). DiscussionOur novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Poly-drug consumption is a dangerous, yet complex model of substance use that contributes to many cases of imprisonment and fatal overdose. Despite the growing number of studies looking at this phenomenon, there remains a lack of neuroimaging data elucidating the neural markers of poly-drug use. In particular, the valuation system, tasked with weighing the value of items and experiences, may hold significance in understanding the motivations behind poly-drug use. To this end, we sought to analyze the functional connectivity of the Valuation System (VS), Executive Control System (ECS) and Valuation-Control Complex (VCC) of drug-using participants in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult dataset (n=992). Using multivariate regression, network-averaged connectivities were correlated with various substance use measures (stimulants, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates, sedatives and marijuana) and demographic variables (gender, parental use history). We found that the VS, ECS and VCC were all correlated with drug use behaviour either as individual systems or when paired with other substances. Both VS (R2= 0.53) and ECS (R2= 0.55) connectivity are positively correlated with stimulant use whereas both ECS (R2= 0.45) and VCC (R2= 0.045) connectivity are negatively correlated with marijuana use. VS (R2= 0.75) and VCC (R2= 0.74) connectivities are also negatively correlated with sedative use. Additionally, network connectivity was correlated with drug use behaviour via two-way interactions with other substances. These findings provide preliminary indications of the consequences of poly-drug use in healthy young adults. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in civilians and highly prevalent among military Servicemembers and in contact sports athletes. mTBI, especially within military populations, is often comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., sensation/novelty seeking, impulsivity, risk taking, irritability/aggression) and substance misuse/abuse, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an established mouse model of blast mTBI, here we examined the effects of single (1x) and repetitive (3x) blast exposure on ethanol responsivity using a battery of tests, each associated with distinct aspects of alcohol abuse vulnerability. While both single and repetitive blast exposure increased the sedative properties of high-dose ethanol (with no change in tolerance or metabolism), only repetitive blast exposure potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and shifted ethanol intake patterns (i.e., increased consumption front-loading) during intermittent two bottle choice. To establish translational relevance, we next examined self-report responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) and used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to investigate whether a history of blast with acute symptoms and mTBI affected drinking behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. AUDIT-C scores were increased in Veterans with a history of blast exposure and subsequent cluster analysis identified a three-cluster solution: low (low intake and low frequency), frequent (low intake but high frequency), and risky (high intake and high frequency), where Veterans with a history of blast mTBI displayed a shift in cluster assignment from frequent to risky, as compared to Veterans who were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan who had no lifetime history of TBI. Together, these results offer new insight regarding how blast mTBI may give rise to increased substance use/misuse and highlight the increased potential for adverse health-risk behaviors following repetitive blast mTBI exposure. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveMethadone is an evidence based treatment for opioid use disorder and is also employed for acute pain. The primary objective of this study was to explore methadone distribution patterns between the years 2017 and 2019 across the United States (US). This study builds upon previous literature ]]>
<![CDATA[ that has analyzed prior years of US distribution patterns, and further outlines regional and state specific methadone trends. MethodsThe Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) was used to acquire the number of narcotic treatment programs (NTPs) per state and methadone distribution weight in grams. Methadone distribution by weight, corrected for state populations, and number of NTPs were compared from 2017 to 2019 between states, within regions, and nationally. ResultsBetween 2017 and 2019, the national distribution of methadone increased 12.30% for NTPs but decreased 34.57% for pain, for a total increase of 2.66%. While all states saw a decrease in distribution for pain, when compared regionally, the Northeast showed a significantly smaller decrease than all other regions. Additionally, the majority of states experienced an increase in distribution for NTPs and most states demonstrated a relatively stable or increasing number of NTPs, with an 11.49% increase in NTPs nationally. The number of NTPs per 100K in 2019 ranged from 2.08 in Rhode Island to 0.00 in Wyoming. ConclusionAlthough methadone distribution for OUD was increasing in the US, there were pronounced regional disparities. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ BackgroundAlthough effective treatments exist, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is undertreated. We used a cascade of care framework to understand gaps in care between diagnosis and treatment for persons with AUD. MethodsUsing 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we evaluated the following steps in the cascade of care: 1) prevalence of adults with AUD; 2) proportion of adults who utilized health care in the past 12 months; 3) were screened about alcohol use; 4) received a brief intervention about alcohol misuse; 5) received information about treatment for alcohol misuse; and 6) proportion of persons with AUD who received treatment. Analyses were stratified by AUD severity. ResultsOf the 171,766 persons included in the sample, weighted prevalence of AUD was 7.9% (95% CI 7.7-8.0%). Persons with AUD utilized health care settings at similar rates as those without AUD. Cascades of care showed the majority of individuals with AUD utilized health care and were screened about alcohol use, but the percent who received the subsequent steps of care decreased substantially. For those with severe AUD, 83.5% (CI: 78.3%-88.7%) utilized health care in the past 12 months, 73.5% (CI: 68.1%-78.9%) were screened for alcohol use, 22.7% (CI: 19.4%-26.0%) received a brief intervention, 12.4% (CI: 10%-14.7%) received information about treatment, and 20.5% (CI: 18%-23.1%) were treated for AUD. The greatest decrease in the care continuum occurred from screening to brief intervention and referral to treatment. More persons with severe AUD received treatment than were referred, indicating other pathways to treatment outside of the healthcare system. ConclusionsPersons with AUD utilize health care at high rates and are frequently screened about alcohol use, but few receive treatment. Health care settings-particularly primary care settings-represent a prime opportunity to implement pharmacologic treatment for AUD to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by compulsive searching for cocaine that produces cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis whose aims to more accurately model micro-structural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. As hypothesized, we found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. Correlations between significant ROIs showed a dependency of impulsivity and years of cocaine consumption over Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white-matter, however their clinical relevance remains questionable. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Impaired inhibitory control accompanied by enhanced salience attributed to drug-related cues, both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functions, are hallmarks of drug addiction, contributing to worse symptomatology including craving. dlPFC modulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed craving reduction in inpatients with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Our study aimed at assessing feasibility of a longer tDCS protocol in CUD (15 vs. the common five/10 sessions), and replicability of previous results. In a randomized double-blind sham-controlled protocol, 17 inpatients were assigned to either a real-tDCS (right anodal/left cathodal) or a sham-tDCS condition, for 15 sessions. Primary outcome measures were self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Secondary measures included sleepiness, readiness to change drug use, and affect. We also assessed cognitive function including impulsivity. An 82% retention rate demonstrated feasibility. Partially supporting previous results, there was a trend for self-reported craving to decrease in the real-tDCS group more than the sham group, an effect that would reach significance with 15 subjects per group. Quality of life and impulsivity improved over time of treatment in both groups. Significant group x time interactions showed improvements after treatment only in the real-tDCS group for daytime sleepiness and readiness to change drug use. One-month follow-up suggested transient effects of tDCS on sleepiness and craving. This study suggests that more subjects are needed to show a unique effect of real-tDCS on craving and to examine the duration of effect. Increased vigilance and motivation to change in the real-tDCS group suggest fortification of dlPFC-supported executive functions. ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ BackgroundMore than 20 million Americans ages 12 and older have a past-year substance use disorder. Majority-minority cities, including Flint, MI, suffer disproportionately from higher rates of substance use and are less likely to have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions relative to predominately White and wealthier cities. Thus, identifying approaches that can improve implementation of evidence-based substance use practices is a critical public health goal. In the current report, we provide a detailed protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the Strengthening Flint Families initiative, a community-based implementation study of a multi-level behavioral health intervention that includes peer recovery coaching, the Strengthening Families Program, and a multimedia campaign. Our goal is to improve family resilience and reduce behavioral health disparities in the Flint community, as an example of how this could be done in other communities. Our overall strategy includes community-informed implementation enhancements to increase adoption and sustainment of evidence-based behavioral health services. MethodsThis project has 4 phases that align with study aims-1) a systematic assessment of behavioral health organizations in the Flint Area to understand organizational needs and strengths in Flint; 2) tailoring implementation strategies for one individual-level evidence-based practice, peer recovery coaching, and one family-level evidence-based program, the Strengthening Families Program; 3) building capacity and promoting sustainability; and 4) evaluating primary (implementation) and secondary (effectiveness) outcomes. Implementation outcomes are derived from the RE-AIM framework and effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at the individual, family, and community levels. DiscussionUnderstanding and addressing the behavioral health organizational needs, strengths, and barriers to program adoption and referral in Flint offers great promise to strengthen the behavioral health network of providers serving Flint residents. Moreover, understanding barriers to accessing and implementing behavioral health services in low-resource communities may prove to be a valuable tool for discovering the most effective implementation methods tailored to specific organizations. These evidence informed approaches may prove useful for cities outside of Flint. Contributions to the literatureMore research is needed on how best to improve community capacity for substance use services, especially in low-income communities This study will examine implementation strategies for improving community adoption and sustainment of a multilevel suite of substance use interventions Study findings will contribute to improved community-wide implementation of evidence-based behavioral health services and increased access to and participation in these services in low-resource communities ]]>

<![CDATA[ AimsTo investigate: (1) alcohol use during the pandemic in the UK; and (2) the extent to which poor inhibitory control and/or stress were associated with any change in alcohol use or hazardous drinking. DesignCross-sectional online survey administered between 2 and 31 May 2020. SettingUK. Participants13,453 respondents aged 19 - 62 years comprising participants of four nationally representative birth cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62-years old). MeasurementsChange in alcohol use and risk of alcohol-related harm due to hazardous drinking and change in stress since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak; inhibitory control (impatience and risk-taking); and sociodemographic characteristics, including diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and key worker status. FindingsMost respondents reported consuming/feeling the same amount or less alcohol/stress. However, a significant minority, particularly among thirty-(29.08%) and fifty-year-olds (26.67%), reported drinking more, and between 32.23% and 45.02% of respondents reported feeling more stressed depending on cohort. Being female was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting heightened stress (OR19 = 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.20; OR30 = 1.93, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.70; OR50 = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.92; OR62 = 2.03, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.48). Stress was associated with hazardous drinking among 30-year-olds (OR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.28). Impatience was associated with both increased alcohol use (1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) and hazardous drinking (1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) among 19-year-olds. Risk-taking was associated with hazardous drinking for 30-year-olds (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). ConclusionsThese data highlight concerns about the UK governments stance on the essential nature of off-premises alcohol sales during the lockdown, particularly from a public health perspective, when considering those at risk of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. ]]>

<![CDATA[ ObjectiveThe current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodData were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. ResultsTwitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. ConclusionsExposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted. ]]>
